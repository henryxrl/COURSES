	<field name="course_intro">First Year Teaching (Secondary Grades) - Success from the Start
Success with your students starts on Day 1. Learn from NTC&#39;s 25 years developing key skills and strategies to create positive, productive classroom environments where students thrive. Build relationships with Secondary Grade (6-12) students, establish and maintain behavioral expectations, implement classroom procedures and routines, and use instructional time effectively.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Developing mastery in establishing and maintaining a rich learning environment is one of the great joys of being a teacher. This course will provide high leverage strategies, resources, and support for professional growth so that you can provide students with the engaging, safe environment essential for student learning. This course is aligned to the needs of Secondary Grade teachers (6-12 grade, usually teaching multiple sections of the same content area, like math, fine arts, science, etc. to students 12 years and older).

This course will teach you how to implement research-based strategies in the following areas: 
Setting and communicating high expectations for students;
Building positive relationships with and between students;
Organizing the learning environment;
Behavioral preventions and interventions; and
Establishing and maintaining routines and procedures that support student learning.
Stellar classrooms don’t just happen—they’re created with the kind of intentional planning and preparation this course offers so that you and your students can be successful from the start!

Recommended Background
Actively teaching, preparing to teach, or interested in teaching in the Secondary Grades (departmental 6-12).

Course Format
The class will consist of videos and discussion posts.  Participants will be expected to respond to instructor and peer discussion posts. Assignments will be classroom based and will be assessed by peers according to provided rubrics.  An end-of-course reflection and survey are required for completion.

FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.

What resources will I need for this class?
For this course, all you need is an Internet connection, and the time to read, write, discuss, and learn about becoming a successful beginning teacher.

I am not sure if I should enroll here, or should enroll in the other course aligned with Elementary Grades. Which course will work best for me?
If you teach in a department based classroom, usually teaching multiple sections in Middle or High School, where you specialize by teaching math, foreign language, language arts, etc. to students usually older than 12, then this is your course! But if you are interested in teaching all subjects in a self-contained classroom, usually in Elementary School (K-5 or K-6) then you should enroll in First Year Teaching (Elementary Grades) - Success from the Start.</field>

This course will explore the forces that led to the 9/11 attacks and the policies the United States adopted in response. We will examine the phenomenon of modern terrorism, the development of the al Qai&#39;da ideology, and the process by which individuals radicalize towards violence.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
The attacks of September 11, 2001, were a seminal moment in modern history. They demonstrated the ability of non-state actors to inflict serious damage on the world&#39;s greatest superpower and exposed the vulnerability of the entire global community to catastrophic acts of terrorism. 

To understand the causes of the attacks, 9/11 and Its Aftermath -- Part I will examine the phenomenon of terrorism, in general, and, more specifically, the radical ideology developed and propagated by Osama bin Laden through al Qai&#39;da. We will consider why individuals are attracted to this ideology and how they radicalize to violence. We will also explore the way in which the United States addressed terrorism prior to 9/11 and the policy challenges it (and its allies around the globe) faced in the immediate aftermath of the attacks. 

The second part of this course -- to be offered sometime in 2014 -- will examine the policy &quot;aftermath&quot; of 9/11. Part II will examine how the United States changed its policies in response to 9/11 in three areas: the use of military force, law enforcement and intelligence activities, and homeland security. We will trace the evolution of these policies from the Bush to the Obama Administration and critically assess the overall counter-terrorism strategy. 

Together, these courses will provide the background necessary to understand why 9/11 occurred, and consider the range of options that democratic nations can use to counteract this form of political violence.

Course Format
Each week will consist of lecture videos, readings, and an assessment. Along with content lectures by Professor Schanzer, there will be videos of student discussions and interviews with various experts. There will be multiple opportunities for engagement with fellow students and Professor Schanzer through Google Hangouts and the discussion forums.

Students will submit weekly posts commenting on an aspect of the materials. In addition, there will be either a quiz or peer assessment for each topic. Students will be asked to think critically about the subject matter and form their own opinions -- this is not a course with right and wrong answers. Rather, it is designed to provide the information necessary to engage in informed debate about difficult issues, think critically, assess tradeoffs, and express your own opinions. 
FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?

Yes. Students who successfully complete the class with a 70% or better will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor. Students who complete the class with a 85% or better will receive a Statement of Accomplishment with Distinction. The Signature Track will be available for this course.

What is the code of ethics for this course?

There is an ethics code relating to your work for the course and participation on the discussion forums. Students will be required to agree to the Coursera Honor Code, which requires that students do their own work and act honorably on assessments. Vibrant and open discussion will be encourage on the discussion forums. Education is advanced by exposure to a full range of ideas and vigorous exchange of perspectives and opinions. Nonetheless, comments that make no contribution to thoughtful discourse and appear to be intended primarily to offend, intimidate, demean, or stifle other will not be tolerated. Posts that violate this standard will be removed from the forums and students unwilling to abide by this standard will be removed from the course.

What is the most important thing I will learn about in this class?

The main objective of the course is to teach students to think critically about controversial, important issues. You will learn to form opinions and craft arguments that are based on facts and substance, not mere feelings or conjecture. You will be exposed to the wide variety of opinion around the globe about the ideas promoted by al Qai’da and like minded groups and the origins of the 9/11 attacks. The course will provide you the basis to be an informed participant in these discussions and debates. You will not be taught what to think or believe about these issues. Rather, you will be provided background information and exposure to ideas so you can to develop your own views and reach your own conclusions from an informed perspective.</field>

Designed for teachers and learners in every setting - in school and out, in formal learning environments or at home - Introduction to Accountable Talk is an introduction to the theory and practice of well-structured talk that builds the mind. You will learn from the growing body of research and from educators who put it into practice, why intentionally structured talk promotes learning and how educators can design talk situations that promote learning. The course includes video examples of children and adults engaging in Accountable Talk in a variety of settings and will enable you to begin to build Accountable Talk in your own learning community. While the Accountable Talk program was originally developed for K-12 classrooms, its structures and practices are readily and productively applicable to any situation in which people get together and talk in order to learn. The course was developed by the School of Education and the Institute for Learning at the University of Pittsburgh. The Institute for Learning was founded by Lauren Resnick, an internationally renowned cognitive psychologist, in 1995. Since then, under Resnick’s leadership, the Institute for Learning has worked to support the improvement of education and achievement of all students in more than 70 school districts in 23 different states.

	<field name="course_intro">An Introduction to Financial Accounting
This course will improve your fluency in financial accounting, the language of business. You will learn how to read, understand, and analyze most of the information provided by companies in their financial statements. These skills will help you make more informed decisions using financial information.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Accounting is the language of business. Companies communicate their performance to outsiders and evaluate the performance of their employees using information generated by the accounting system.  Learning the language of accounting is essential for anyone that must make decisions based on financial information. 

The course is designed to provide an understanding of financial accounting fundamentals for prospective users of corporate financial information, such as investors, creditors, employees, and other stakeholders (e.g., suppliers, customers).   The course focuses on understanding how economic events such as operating activities, corporate investments, and financing transactions are recorded in the three main financial statements (i.e., the income statement, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows). Students will develop the technical skills needed to analyze financial statements and disclosures for use in financial analysis.  Students will also learn how accounting standards and managerial incentives affect the financial reporting process.  

Course Syllabus
The course is broken up into ten weekly modules:

Introduction and Balance Sheet
Accrual Accounting and the Income Statement
Cash flows
Working capital assets
Ratio analysis and Mid-course Exam
Long-lived assets and marketable securities
Liabilities and long-term debt
Deferred taxes
Stockholders’ equity
How to read an Annual Report and Final Exam 
Recommended Background
The course is recommended for students with little or no prior background in financial accounting that want to improve their financial literacy.  There are no academic prerequisites for the course.  Although we will work with numbers in the course, the only required math knowledge is addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Suggested Readings
The course is designed to be self-contained.  Students wanting to expand their knowledge beyond what we can cover in this course or who want more practice problems or more in-depth explanations can consult any Introduction to Financial Accounting textbook that is geared toward MBA students.  Because the material in the course has been fairly unchanged for the past few years, any used prior editions of textbooks should be acceptable.   

Course Format
The course will combine video of the instructor with Powerpoint slides to the deliver the material.  The lectures will be “interactive” in that the instructor will periodically ask students to pause the presentation and guess an answer before proceeding.  The videos will also cover “case studies” of real companies to illustrate the course concepts.  The course will provide eight short homework assignments and two exams.  

FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?

Contingent on academic performance, you will get a Statement of Accomplishment stating that you completed this course.  However, no certificate will be given from Wharton / Penn and successful completion of this course does not make you a Wharton / Penn alumnus.

 

What resources will I need for this class?

Everything you need will be provided via the Coursera platform.

 

What is the coolest thing I&#39;ll learn if I take this class?

You will not only better understand what people in the business media are talking about, you will also be able to notice when they don’t know what they are talking about!

This course is designed to look at the topics covered in advanced high school chemistry courses, correlating to the standard topics as established by the American Chemical Society. Engaging instruction and supplemental video demonstrations are designed to help prepare students for college level chemistry.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Many students leave high school without being prepared for the rigors of college chemistry. This course is designed to give students the opportunity to review topics at a pace conducive to their level, whether they are encountering the material for the first time or are using the course as a refresher.

Allison Soult and Kim Woodrum bring their experience to the course covering kinetics, equilibrium, acid-base equilibria, aqueous equilibria and thermodynamics. Instruction consists of concepts, calculations, and video demonstrations of the principles being discussed. Practice problems and end of unit assessments will help students gauge their understanding of the material.


Course Syllabus
This ten-week course is comprised of five two-part units. Each part is intended to be completed in a week.

Kinetics 
This unit examines the rates (speeds) at which reactions occur. You will examine the reactions on the macroscopic as well as molecular level and see how concentration and temperature play a role in the rates at which reactions occur.

Equilibrium
This unit examines the quantitative and qualitative relationships between the relative amounts of products and reactants to see how far a reaction will proceed.

Acid-Base Equilibria 
The concepts of equilibria from the previous unit are applied to acids and bases.  Comparisons of strength and relationships between pH, pOH, and concentrations of H^+ and OH^- will be studied.

Aqueous Equilibria
This unit continues and expands on the theme of equlibria. You will examine buffers, acid/base titrations and the equilibria of insoluble salts.

Thermodynamics
The overarching theme of thermodynamics is the prediction of whether a reaction will occur spontaneously under a certain set of conditions. Entropy and Free Energy are defined and utilized for this purpose.
Recommended Background
Students should have a background in basic chemistry including nomenclature, reactions, stoichiometry, molarity and thermochemistry.  Access to a scientific calculator is needed.
Suggested Readings
Any college level general chemistry textbook.
Course Format
The class consists of lecture videos, which are approximately 10 to 15 minutes in length. Practice problems, accompanying videos, and answer sets are included that correspond with each lecture video. Tests are administered at the end of the five main course topics.</field>

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This course will expand your understanding of blended and online instruction and hone your skills in the implementation of instructional strategies. In week one we&#39;ll discuss what it means to be a virtual teacher, examine what training is available for educators, and explore what career opportunities exist today. In week two we&#39;ll focus on using data and tools effectively, as well as implementing (and perhaps creating) your curriculum. We&#39;ll then delve into key strategies for developing classroom cultures focused on collaboration, respect, and inclusiveness. In week four we’ll examine lesson planning strategies for increased student engagement and success. We’ll also discuss ways to differentiate instruction for all learners using data and feedback to guide the process. Lastly, we&#39;ll consider the role of the student, teacher, and parents/guardians in the virtual classroom. By the end of this course, we hope that students will have expanded their toolbox of instructional strategies that can be immediately applied in online and blended classrooms.

	<field name="course_intro">21st Century American Foreign Policy
What is American foreign policy? Who makes it? Why is it the way it is? How does it affect the rest of the world? Professor Bruce Jentleson has taught the subject for over 30 years, written one of the leading books on it, and has served in numerous U.S. foreign policy positions.

Preview Lectures</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
U.S. foreign policy has a huge impact on the world. That impact is widely debated among Americans and by people in many countries. Our goal in this course is to gain more understanding of what U.S. foreign policy is, who makes it, why is it the way it is, and how it affects the rest of the world. Through lectures, readings, and other course elements we build on the information available from the media and other such sources while delving deeper into the issues, their history, their broader context and major debates. We seek to do so as a community of learning committed not only to the curricular objectives for our course, but seeking to demonstrate to the world how to conduct informed and respectful discourse on subjects which have plenty of room for disagreement.

The first week of the course provides an overview and analytic framework, and focuses in on the process and politics by which U.S. foreign policy is made. Each of the next five weeks is geared to U.S. foreign policy in different regions: Asia with a particular focus on U.S.-China relations; the Middle East and such issues as Iran, Arab-Israeli peace, Syria, and the Arab uprisings; relations with Western Europe and Russia; relations in the Western Hemisphere with Latin America and Canada; and key issues in U.S.-Africa relations. While we cannot cover all issues, we do try for a balance of breadth and depth.
Course Syllabus
Six weeks organized into six units:

Course Overview, Analytic Framework and the Making of U.S. Foreign Policy
Asia’s Rising Strategic Importance: U.S. Relations with China and in the Asia-Pacific Region
War, Peace, Terrorism, Democracy:  Old and New Challenges in the Middle East
Old Friends, Old Enemy: 21st Century Relations with Europe and Russia
The Americas: Relations with Latin America and Canada
Africa: Persisting Old Issues, Pressing Newer Ones
Recommended Background
Strong interest in world politics and international affairs is the most important requirement. Prior relevant knowledge from one’s own education and any professional work experience would be great, both for you and for our community of learning.
Suggested Readings
The course draws extensively on my book American Foreign Policy: The Dynamics of Choice in the 21st Century (New York: W.W. Norton and Company, 5th edition 2013), just published in its 5th edition. Two chapters are available on our course website; if interested, the book can be purchased from W.W. Norton or various others. Selected articles and other relevant readings will also be assigned.
Course Format
Each week is structured as a unit on one of the topics listed on the syllabus. Each of these units will have four or five components consisting of a video lecture, background readings, quizzes and other learning reinforcement exercises. We also will use the message board and other mechanisms for dialogue among the students and with the professor and teaching team.
FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?

Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.

What resources will I need for this class?

For this course, all you need is an Internet connection and the time to read, write, discuss, and think about our topic.

Is this course only for Americans?

Definitely not. American foreign policy affects people all around the world. This is an opportunity to learn more about it, and for our community of learning to be a truly global one sharing ideas, viewpoints and aspirations.

Will this be just like watching CNN International, BBC, al Jazeera or other such news sources? 

While we of course will address many issues of the day, we seek to delve more deeply into the issues, their history, their broader context and major debates. 

What is the coolest thing I&#39;ll learn if I take this class? 
Everyone has their own conception of what’s “cool”; for me it includes learning more about the world in which we live.</field>

The course will also include a discussion of the populations that are particularly vulnerable to HIV/AIDS and a look at future challenges facing people infected and affected by the AIDS pandemic.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Did you grow up in a world without red ribbons, AZT, the AIDS Memorial Quilt, or Project Red? If you did, chances are good that you came of age before 1981 and are a member of the last generation of humans on this planet to be able to say that you remember those ‘carefree days when all you had to worry about was getting pregnant, herpes, and a bad reputation’ (AID Atlanta).

On June 5, 1981 the CDC released a Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report describing the first five cases of what later became known as the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, or AIDS. On that day human history broke into two generations: Those who can remember a time before the AIDS pandemic and those who can&#39;t.

No matter what generation you grew up in, what we all have in common is a curiosity about AIDS.  Where did it come from? Why is it so widespread?  Are we making progress towards a vaccine? What is it like to be part of a vaccine trial? Has anyone ever been cured of HIV infection? Are some people just naturally more or less susceptible to HIV than other people are?

All of this and more will be covered in AIDS. Over the course of nine weeks we will discuss a wide range of issues, innovations, and controversies regarding HIV/AIDS in the US and around the world including everything from what circumcision and Truvada have in common; how school children in Africa are changing the way AIDS education is done; where you can go online to learn how many cases of AIDS there are in your area; and how one man’s insistence that AIDS doesn&#39;t exist left hundreds of thousands of people without access to life saving drugs.

Course Format
The course will consist of lectures, readings, and related assignments. Assignments will include generating lessons learned, taking quizzes and writing peer-evaluated essays.

FAQ
What happens when I click “Sign Up?”
Clicking “Sign Up” will result in adding you to a listserv of people to be notified by email when the class is ready to run.

Will I get a certificate after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete all class assignments will receive a certificate signed by the instructor.

Do I earn Emory University credits upon completion of this class?
No. The certificate of completion is not transferable for course credit at Emory University. It is good, however, for demonstrating how much initiative and stick-to-a-tiveness you have (it is going to take time out of your life every week for more than two months after all). In addition, should anyone ever say: “Oh yeah? So what makes YOU an expert on HIV/AIDS?” you can always say: “THIS does!” and shake your certificate in their face. That should shut them up.

What resources will I need for this class?
Curiosity, an open mind, time to watch videos, a commitment to engage with your fellow students in discussions of the material, and a tolerance for the fact that the instructor tends to live by the motto: &quot;Just because I take my science seriously doesn&#39;t mean I have to take myself seriously.&quot;

What is the coolest thing I&#39;ll learn if I take this class?
Yeah, right .... Like I&#39;m going to give away the punch line before you enroll in the class.</field>

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
The course aims to provide a foundation in artificial intelligence techniques for planning, with an overview of the wide spectrum of different problems and approaches, including their underlying theory and their applications. It will allow you to:
Understand different planning problems
Have the basic know how to design and implement AI planning systems
Know how to use AI planning technology for projects in different application domains
Have the ability to make use of AI planning literature
Planning is a fundamental part of intelligent systems. In this course, for example, you will learn the basic algorithms that are used in robots to deliberate over a course of actions to take. Simpler, reactive robots don&#39;t need this, but if a robot is to act intelligently, this type of reasoning about actions is vital.

Recommended Background
The MOOC is based on a Masters level course at the University of Edinburgh but is designed to be accessible at several levels of engagement from an &quot;Awareness Level&quot;, through the core &quot;Foundation Level&quot; requiring a basic knowledge of logic and mathematical reasoning, to a more involved &quot;Performance Level&quot; requiring programming and other assignments.

Suggested Readings
The course follows a text book, but this is not required for the course: 
Automated Planning: Theory &amp; Practice (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Artificial Intelligence) by M. Ghallab, D. Nau, and P. Traverso (Elsevier, ISBN 1-55860-856-7) 2004.
Course Format
Five weeks of study comprising 10 hours of video lecture material and special features videos. Quizzes and assessments throughout the course will assist in learning. Some weeks will involve recommended readings. Discussion on the course forum and via other social media will be encouraged. A mid-course catch up break week and a final week for exams and completion of assignments allows for flexibility in study.

You can engage with the course at a number of levels to suit your interests and the time you have available:

Awareness Level - gives an overview of the topic, along with introductory videos and application related features. This level is likely to require 2-3 hours of study per week.
Foundation Level - is the core taught material on the course and gives a grounding in AI planning technology and algorithms. This level is likely to require 5-6 hours of study per week of study.
Performance Level - is for those interested in carrying out additional programming assignments and engaging in creative challenges to understand the subject more deeply. This level is likely to require 8 hours or more of study per week.
FAQ
Will I get a certificate after completing this class?
Students who complete the class will be offered a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructors.

Do I earn University of Edinburgh credits upon completion of this class?
The Statement of Accomplishment is not part of a formal qualification from the University. However, it may be useful to demonstrate prior learning and interest in your subject to a higher education institution or potential employer.

What resources will I need for this class?
Nothing is required, but if you want to try out implementing some of the algorithms described in the lectures you&#39;ll need access to a programming environment. No specific programming language is required. Also, you may want to download existing planners and try those out. This may require you to compile them first.

Can I contact the course lecturers directly?
You will appreciate that such direct contact would be difficult to manage. You are encouraged to use the course social network and discussion forum to raise questions and seek inputs. The tutors will participate in the forums, and will seek to answer frequently asked questions, in some cases by adding to the course FAQ area.

What Twitter hash tag should I use?
Use the hash tag #aiplan for tweets about the course.

How come this is free?
We are passionate about open on-line collaboration and education. Our taught AI planning course at Edinburgh has always published its course materials, readings and resources on-line for anyone to view. Our own on-campus students can access these materials at times when the course is not available if it is relevant to their interests and projects. We want to make the materials available in a more accessible form that can reach a broader audience who might be interested in AI planning technology. This achieves our primary objective of getting such technology into productive use. Another benefit for us is that more people get to know about courses in AI in the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh, or get interested in studying or collaborating with us.

When will the course run again?
It is likely that the 2015 session will be the final time this course runs as a Coursera MOOC, but we intend to leave the course wiki open for further study and use across course instances.</field>

Suggested Readings
We highly recommend ALEKS software be used in conjunction with the course.  Though not required, this software will allow students more algebra practice opportunities and a more individualized course experience in which you focus just on those topics you have yet to master. 

Assessment and LEarning in Knowledge Spaces is a Web-based, artificially intelligent assessment and learning system. ALEKS uses adaptive questioning to quickly and accurately determine exactly what a student knows and doesn&#39;t know in a course. ALEKS then instructs the student on the topics she is most ready to learn. As a student works through a course, ALEKS periodically reassesses the student to ensure that topics learned are also retained. 


The ALEKS subscription will also enable you limited access to content from the textbook &quot;Precalculus&quot; by Barnett, Ziegler, Byleen and Sobecki; this access is in the form of PDF files linked from the Explanation pages of particular topics in ALEKS. Some students may prefer a physical version of this textbook. You can purchase that from any online textbook retailer. (Any edition of this text is fine!)

Course Format
This course is divided into topical sections, released on a weekly basis. Each week will consist of a series of lecture videos, short quizzes, and suggested readings and homework assignments.
FAQ
Will I get a certificate after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment from Coursera.

Part of the &quot;Fundamentals of Computing&quot; Specialization »
Experienced Computer Scientists analyze and solve computational problems at a level of abstraction that is beyond that of any particular programming language. This class is designed to train students in the mathematical concepts and process of &quot;Algorithmic Thinking&quot;, allowing them to build simpler, more efficient solutions to computational problems.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
When presented with a problem from a scientific domain, a Computer Scientist goes through a set of steps in order to provide a solution for the problem. These steps include: (1) understanding the problem; (2) formulating the problem mathematically; (3) designing an algorithm; (4) implementing the algorithm; and (5) solving the original scientific problem. This course will train students in how to employ algorithmic thinking by following these five steps to solve real-world problems. 

Understanding the problem entails holding conversations with domain experts to understand the parameters of the problem, what data they can provide to the computer program, what answers they expect, etc. Formulating the problem mathematically is basically the step of turning the problem from an English description to a mathematical description that is amenable to further computational analyses. 

While the course emphasizes implementing the algorithms and solving the original problems that gave rise to the need for these algorithms in the first place, much of the course will be devoted to the third step, namely, algorithm design. Here, the course will introduce students to different algorithm design strategies, as well as mathematical tools for reasoning about the correctness and efficiency of algorithms.  
Course Syllabus
Our course syllabus can be viewed at www.codeskulptor.org/coursera/algorithmicthinking.html.
Recommended Background
Prior mathematical and programming experience at the level of &quot;Principles of Computing&quot; (PoC). Students that have not taken PoC are welcome, but should be comfortable writing intermediate size  (300+ line) programs in Python and have a basic understanding of searching, sorting, and recursion. The first week of class will include an optional placement exam to help students accurately assess whether they have the necessary background to take this class.
Course Format
This course will last eight weeks.  The lectures from each week will focus on the topics listed in the syllabus while an associated weekly &quot;mini-project&quot; will serve to reinforce these concepts in practice. Grades for these mini-projects will be determined via a combination of machine grading and peer-assessment. The class will also include homeworks to provide further feedback.
FAQ
Will I get a certificate after completing this class? 
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by Luay, Scott, and Joe.
What resources will I need for this class? 
The only requirement for the class is access to a modern web browser. All coding and program development will be done in a web-based programming environment that supports building applications in Python. The programs that you create will be saved, shared and graded via the cloud.
What is the most useful thing I&#39;ll learn if I take this class? 
The ability to think and solve computational problems at a higher level of abstraction, allowing you to create programs that are simpler and more efficient.</field>

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
An introduction to fundamental data types, algorithms, and data structures, with emphasis on applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations. Specific topics covered include: union-find algorithms; basic iterable data types (stack, queues, and bags); sorting algorithms (quicksort, mergesort, heapsort) and applications; priority queues; binary search trees; red-black trees; hash tables; and symbol-table applications.
Recommended Background
All you need is a basic familiarity with programming in Java. This course is primarily aimed at first- and second-year undergraduates interested in engineering or science, along with high school students and professionals with an interest (and some background) in programming.
Suggested Readings
Although the lectures are designed to be self-contained, students wanting to expand their knowledge beyond what we can cover in a 6-week class can find a much more extensive coverage of this topic in our book Algorithms, Part I (4th Edition), published by Addison-Wesley.
Course Format
There will be two lectures (60-75 minutes each) each week. The lectures are divided into about 4-6 segments, separated by interactive quiz questions for you to to help you process and understand the material. In addition, there will be a problem set and a programming assignment each week and there will be a final exam.
FAQ
What algorithms and data structures are covered?
Part I focuses on elementary data structures, sorting, and searching. Topics include union-find, binary search, stacks, queues, bags, insertion sort, selection sort, shellsort, quicksort, 3-way quicksort, mergesort,heapsort, binary heaps, binary search trees, red-black trees, separate chaining and linear probing hash tables, Graham scan, and kd-trees.

Part II focuses on graph and string-processing algorithms. Topics include depth-first search, breadth-first search, topological sort, Kosaraju-Sharir, Kruskal, Prim, Dijkistra, Bellman-Ford, Ford-Fulkerson, LSD radix sort, MSD radix sort, 3-way radix quicksort, multiway tries, ternary search tries, Knuth-Morris-Pratt, Boyer-Moore, Rabin-Karp, regular expression matching, run-length coding, Huffman coding, LZW compression, and the Burrows-Wheeler transform.

Are there any associated resources available on the web?
Yes. Our free booksite contains synopses of the text, web exercises, Java implementations of all the algorithms covered (any many more) that are designed for you to be able to download and use with one click, test data, and many other resources.

How does this course differ from Design and Analysis of Algorithms?
The two courses are complementary. This one is essentially a programming course that concentrates on developing code; that one is essentially a math course that concentrates on understanding proofs. This course is about learning algorithms in the context of implementing and testing them in practical applications; that one is about learning algorithms in the context of developing mathematical models that help explain why they are efficient. In typical computer science curriculums, a course like this one is taken by first- and second-year students and a course like that one is taken by juniors and seniors.

I am/was not a computer science major. Is this course for me?
Yes. This course is for anyone using a computer to address large problems (and therefore needing efficient algorithms). At Princeton, over 25% of all students take the course, including people majoring in engineering, biology, physics, chemistry, economics, and many other fields, not just computer science.

If I have no familiarity with Java programming, can I still take the course?
Our central thesis is that algorithms are best understood by implementing and testing them. Our use of Java is essentially expository, and we shy away from exotic features, so we expect you would be able to adapt our code to your favorite language. However, we require that you submit the programming assignments in Java. If you have some experience programming in another language, you might find it worthwhile to learn our programming model by studying our book An Introduction to Programming in Java: An Interdisciplinary Approach and associated free booksite.

If I have not programmed before, can I still take the course?
Probably not.

Does Princeton University award credentials or reports regarding my work in this course?
No certificates, statements of accomplishment, or other credentials will be awarded in connection with this course.</field>

Topics include depth-first search, breadth-first search, topological sort, Kosaraju-Sharir, Kruskal, Prim, Dijkistra, Bellman-Ford, Ford-Fulkerson, LSD radix sort, MSD radix sort, 3-way radix quicksort, multiway tries, ternary search tries, Knuth-Morris-Pratt, Boyer-Moore, Rabin-Karp, regular expression matching, run-length coding, Huffman coding, LZW compression, and the Burrows-Wheeler transform.

Are there any associated resources available on the web?
Yes. Our free booksite contains synopses of the text, web exercises, Java implementations of all the algorithms covered (any many more) that are designed for you to be able to download and use with one click, test data, and many other resources.

How does this course differ from Design and Analysis of Algorithms?
The two courses are complementary. This one is essentially a programming course that concentrates on developing code; that one is essentially a math course that concentrates on understanding proofs. This course is about learning algorithms in the context of implementing and testing them in practical applications; that one is about learning algorithms in the context of developing mathematical models that help explain why they are efficient. In typical computer science curriculums, a course like this one is taken by first- and second-year students and a course like that one is taken by juniors and seniors.

I&#39;d like to take Algorithms, Part II, but missed Part I. What should I do?
It depends on your background. If you have absolutely no familiarity with basic data types and classic sorting and searching algorithms, you probably need to wait for the next offering of Part I. If you have some familiarity with the basics, you may be able to get up to speed by studying our book and our booksite.

I am/was not a computer science major. Is this course for me?
Yes. This course is for anyone using a computer to address large problems (and therefore needing efficient algorithms). At Princeton, over 25% of all students take the course, including people majoring in engineering, biology, physics, chemistry, economics, and many other fields, not just computer science.

If I have no familiarity with Java programming, can I still take the course?
Our central thesis is that algorithms are best understood by implementing and testing them. Our use of Java is essentially expository, and we shy away from exotic features, so we expect you would be able to adapt our code to your favorite language. However, we require that you submit the programming assignments in Java. If you have some experience programming in another language, you might find it worthwhile to learn our programming model by studying our book An Introduction to Programming in Java: An Interdisciplinary Approach and associated free booksite.

If I have not programmed before, can I still take the course?
Probably not.

Does Princeton University award credentials or reports regarding my work in this course?
No certificates, statements of accomplishment, or other credentials will be awarded in connection with this course.</field>

If chemistry is the science of stuff, then analytical chemistry answers the question: what is it? And how much of it do you have? This course teaches how to do this with instrumental analysis!

Preview Lectures</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This course covers about a half a semester of instrumental analysis which is a standard part of the undergraduate chemistry curriculum. Any chemist has to understand how to analyze samples - whether they are water samples, blood samples or bits of a painting. Most often chemists do this using instruments of some sort. Machines like mass spectrometers or gas chromatographs can indicate both what&#39;s in a sample (qualitative) as well as how much of something there is(quantitative). If you are fascinated by shows like CSI, and have enough basic chemistry, this course would be great for you. However, the course is first and foremost designed for chemistry students working towards their degree.
Students who complete this class will understand that analytical instruments are not black boxes, but rather complex tools whose utility depends in detail on how analysts both configure and apply them. Towards that end there are three pimary objectives. First, students will learn facts about major classes of instruments commonly used in chemical analysis. Their knowledge will be captured by the ability to block diagram these complex pieces of equipment, and tailor the specifications to the measurement needs. Second, the course will cover the basics of instrumental calibration and quality control. Analysts will develop the ability to apply calibration curves, internal standards and the method of standard addition as needed for various measurement problems. Finally, students must learn how to select and tailor the best instrumental method given a particular measurement need. This higher level skill involves critical evaluation of the strengths and limitations of the various method, and the ability to understand the context behind a measurement need.
Course Syllabus
Description: This course will provide students with a background in modern analytical chemistry with an emphasis on instrumentation. Applications of instrumental analytical chemistry in medicine, forensics and materials science will be presented. Course objectives:
To reinforce chemical principles central to analytical chemistry.
To introduce instrumental techniques for chemical measurement.
To develop critical thinking for interpreting analytical data.
To select instrumentation appropriate to the measurement need.
Week 1: Overview of instrumental analysis and basic chemistry review Week 2: Atomic spectroscopies and the analysis of metals Week 3: Calibration, QA/QC, and improving instrumental analysis Week 4: The basic principles of chromatography Week 5: Gas chromatography Week 6: Liquid chromatography Week 7: Vibrational spectroscopies Week 8: Electronic and optical sensors
Recommended Background
You should be familiar with freshman chemistry including balancing chemical equations, chemical equilibria, acid and base chemistry, stoichiometric calculations, reduction and oxidation chemistry and interaction of light with matter.
Suggested Readings
This course is loosely based on Skoog, West, Holler and Crouch, Fundamentals of Analytical Chemistry , 8th edition. 
Course Format
This class will consist of lecture videos, between 8 and 12 minutes in length. Most will include 1-2 integrated quiz questions per video; in addition, optional standalone quizzes will be provided to reinforce video lecture material and any additional reading. Not optional weekly problem sets will be the primary way to assess learning in the class. To develop critical thinking skills, three case studies will be provided throughout the class and the results will be assessed by course peers. A non-optional final problem set will evalaute integrated knowledge and retention of material. Every week there will be 6 to 8 short, usually less than 15 minutes, video lectures sometimes including interactive quizzes.  In addition every week there will be a problem set, and 1 to 3 quizzes which cover the material in the lectures.  Reading material will be provided each week from the web and to support the development of case studies. 
FAQ
Will I get a certificate after completing this class?
Rice University does award a certificate for completing this class and there will also be the opportunity for a certification with distinction.</field>

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Science is really not about looking up facts in an encyclopedia.  It is a process that extends what we know into the realm of the unexplored.  This can be exciting, certainly; to be able to sneak a peek at the Universe at its strange, awesome, cosmic best.  But it is very different from your run-of-the-mill standard “textbook” idea of science.  Science is a social, human endeavor.

And as human beings, we crave authenticity.  We have seen the trappings of society, we act as if we have mastered technology, and yet we know that something is lacking.  We have succumbed to the lure of Ebay, Facebook and Amazon (at least, I know I have!), and yet we remain unsatisfied at some primal level.  It’s time to peel away the layers of glitzy imagery and use our machines to exploit their ultimate purpose: the capability to  process large amounts of data with instructions that we provide, in order to test our ideas about how the Universe seems to behave.  In short, to do Science.  For the first time, it is possible for the interested student (and we are all students, especially those that have any claim to be considered “learned” , such as the instructor!) to have this experience on-line. 

The subject matter for this course will be divided into two broad components which will be interwoven in an interdisciplinary fashion. The first is a general introduction to the physics and astronomy information you will need to understand basic phenomena that occur in the realm of x-ray astrophysics; the second is the presentation of authentic satellite data from various exciting types of x-ray sources, which you will analyze to better understand the working of the high-energy Universe in which we live. There are no prerequisites for this course, other than high-school mathematics (algebra and trigonometry).

I hope you will enjoy your experience in &quot;Analyzing the Universe&quot;.</field>

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This course is a survey of ancient Greek history, covering the roughly 13 centuries that extended from the Minoan / Mycenaean Bronze Age (ca. 1800-1200 BCE) down to the death of Socrates in 399 BCE.  Along with studying the most important events and personalities, we will consider broader issues such as political and cultural values and methods of historical interpretation. 
Some of the topics we will cover include: relations between the Greeks and their neighbors to the East; Homer and the heroic ideal; the development of the type of community called the &quot;polis&quot;; the diffusion of Greek civilization from Southern Italy to the shores of the Black Sea; gods and mortals in myth, religion and ritual; the roles of women; Athenian drama; the treatment of slaves and foreigners; and the birth and evolution of democracy. We will strive to get as full an understanding as we can of this extraordinary, and extraordinarily influential, society. 

Almost all the reading assignments are from ancient sources in translation. No previous knowledge of ancient history is assumed. 
Course Syllabus
There follows a complete course outline, with a brief descriptive title for each of the lectures. The list also includes the reading assignments, which you  should try to complete before viewing the lecture. All the assignments can be accessed online. 

WEEK 1: Prehistory to Homer 
1.1 Introduction: the natural setting, geography and climate. 
1.2 Minoan civilization (ca. 1800-1500 BCE)

1.4 The Dark Ages (ca. 1150-800 BCE) 
1.5 Homer 1 - Iliad 
Assignment: Iliad, Books 1, 2, 6, 9, 18, 24. As you read these selections, pay close attention to how the characters interact with each other. 
There are at least four excellent, widely available modern English translations of both epics, by (in chronological order) Richmond Lattimore, Robert Fitzgerald, Robert Fagles, and Stanley Lombardo. 
Available online is a fine contemporary translation by Ian Johnston – 
http://records.viu.ca/~johnstoi/homer/iliad1.htm 
1.6 Homer 2 - Odyssey
Assignment: Odyssey, Books 1, 5, 9-12, 21-24. As you read, think about how this poem is similar to, and different from, the Iliad. 
Also available online are: a late-19th-century version by Samuel Butler – 
http://www.online-literature.com/homer/odyssey/ 
and an early-20th-century version by A. T. Taylor – 
http://www.theoi.com/Text/HomerOdyssey1.html 

WEEK 2: The Archaic Age (ca. 800-500 BCE) 
2.1 The polis. 
Assignment: read the following selection from Book 1 of Aristotle&#39;s Politics: 
http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/Aristotle-politics-polis.asp 
What are the main elements in Aristotle&#39;s definition of the polis? 
Also read: these selections from Plutarch&#39;s Life of Theseus, and think about how the myth of Theseus serves as a kind of retrospective story about the foundation of the Athenian polis. 
2.2 &quot;The Greeks overseas&quot;: colonization. 
Assignment: examine this interactive map [created at Wesleyan] for a vivid overview of the colonial enterprise; as you click the boxes along the bottom of the map, you will see how many Greek communities were established between the 8th and 6th centuries BCE. You can also click on the names of several of the colonies for links to additional information.  
Also read: a selection from Herodotus, Bk. 4  for the story of the foundation of Cyrene in North Africa (in modern Libya). 
2.3 Literacy, lawgivers and law codes. 
Assignment: read Plutarch&#39;s Life of Solon, chapters 1-16; also read some of Solon&#39;s poetry, in particular # 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 36. 
2.4 The works of Ares – hoplite warfare. 
Assignment: read the excellent short essay on hoplite warfare produced by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. 
2.5 New voices, the lyric poets. 
Assignment: read some selections from 
Archilochus 
Theognis [there are 20 short sections; you have to click on &quot;next poem&quot; to get from one to another] 
Sappho 
Alcaeus 
2.6 Hesiod: gods and farmers. 
Assignment: read Hesiod&#39;s Theogony [This is a pdf file, for which you will need Adobe Reader; if you don&#39;t have Adobe, you can read an older but good version here.] Also read Hesiod&#39;s Works and Days, particularly lines 1-266. For each poem, don&#39;t even try to remember all the names and details, but pay attention to the main themes. For the Theogony, the principal concerns include the development of order in the universe and the ultimate triumph of Zeus; for Works and Days, think about human and divine justice, and the central role of agricultural labor. 

WEEK 3 Two City-States: Sparta and Athens 
3.1 Sparta 1 – conquest. 
Assignment: read the poems of Tyrtaeus, Terpander and Alcman. 
3.2 Sparta 2 – consolidation and the Spartan way of life. 
Assignment: read the so-called &quot;Constitution of Sparta,&quot; and skim Plutarch&#39;s Life of Lycurgus. 
3.3 Tyrants and Sages. 
3.4 Athens 1 – the social and economic situation through 600 BCE. 
3.5 Athens 2 – Solon: poetry, politics and economics. 
Assignment: re-read Plutarch&#39;s Life of Solon; also read the excerpt from Herodotus 1 about Solon and Croesus, the king of Lydia, and [Aristotle&#39;s] Constitution of Athens chapters 5-12(scroll down).

Introduction to the design and implementation of applications for handheld systems, such as smartphones and tablets, running the Android Platform.

Preview Lectures</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Handheld systems, such as smartphones and tablets are now the most common way for people to access and interact with computing services. The demand for application development skills is therefore growing at a breathtaking pace. These skills, however, are multi-­‐ faceted, requiring students to master computer science and engineering principles, to learn the details of specific mobile application platforms, and to design artistic and engaging user interfaces that respond to how, where and why handheld applications are used.

This course will cover the fundamental programming principles, software architecture and user experience considerations underlying handheld software applications and their development environments. To bring these concepts alive, the course will involve in-­‐depth, hands-­‐on examples, implemented in the Android Platform, the fastest growing segment of the handheld system user base. Students will apply these teachings, also using the Android Platform, in laboratory projects and in a large-­‐scale semester project. 

Note: This course is part of a trans-institution course sequence. 

This course and two others, led respectively by Drs. Douglas Schmidt and Jules White of Vanderbilt University, have been designed to complement each other. Therefore, some of the programming assignments and the course project for these courses will be coordinated.

This course focuses on handheld systems and the design of user-facing applications, and will be taught first. The first Vanderbilt University course, Pattern-Oriented Software Architectures: Programming Mobile Services for Android Handheld Systems will focus on systems programming topics, such as middleware services and background processing, That course is currently schedule to start in March 2014. The second Vanderbilt University course, Programming Cloud Services for Android Handheld Systems will focus on connecting Android mobile devices to cloud computing and data storage resources, essentially turning a device into an extension of powerful cloud-based services on popular cloud computing platforms, such as Google App Engine and Amazon EC2. That course is currently scheduled to begin in early June 2014.

Nevertheless, each of these courses stands alone. Students are not required to take all of them. Those who do, however, will gain a much more detailed, end-to-end understanding of handheld systems and their applications.

Course Syllabus
Tentative Schedule

Week #1:

•  Lecture #1 – The Android Platform

•  Lecture #2 – The Android Development Environment

Final Project: iRemember

We&#39;ll implement the front end of a complex handheld application involving many of the concepts presented in the class. 

Recommended Background
This course is directed to Sophomore- or Junior-level undergraduate students. Students should already know how to program in Java, but are not expected to have studied mobile application development. 

If you don&#39;t already know Java, but have some familiarity with programming languages, you can improve your Java knowledge, by taking one of the many Java tutorials and online courses available on the web.
Suggested Readings
There is no textbook for this course, but I strongly encourage students to explore the wide range of freely-available Android-related resources.
Keep up with changes and improvements in the Android ecosystem by reading the Android Developer&#39;s Blog.
Watch tutorials and other presentations from the Google I/O conference.
Course Format
Each lesson will consist of video presentations, logically divided roughly into 5-10 minute sections. Throughout the lecture video there are ungraded &quot;in-video&quot; questions to help ensure that students are understanding the material.  Each week there is also a short quiz containing questions/tasks to help ensure that the students have understood that week&#39;s lectures. 

The in-video questions are related to the current video section, and provide supplementary information, “Food For Thought” discussion, and &quot;FLASHBACK&quot; questions, which challenge the students to think about something we have discussed in a previous lesson.

Each week&#39;s videos will be accompanied by a lab exercise consisting of an assignment write-up, partially completed source code, and executable test cases. The students will run the test cases on their own computers to determine whether they&#39;ve successfully completed the lab. For some labs, we will also require students to examine and grade the submissions of other students.

Each lesson covers multiple Android source code examples. I strongly encourage students to download all the examples and to consult them both while watching the lecture and afterwards. The source code is publicly available on github:

https://github.com/aporter/coursera-android

The course will also have a complex final project. 
FAQ
Some Frequently Asked Questions. 
When I try to watch the videos before the class start, I get an error message.
You can preview some of the videos by pressing the &quot;Preview Lectures&quot; Button at the top of the course webpage

Is the course broadcast live? I live on the other side of the world from you!
No. Course lectures are videotaped. Students watch the lectures and do programming assignments and quizzes when it&#39;s convenient for them.

What are the course objectives?
Upon completing this course, students should be able to:

Understand the Android platform&#39;s organization, patterns and programming mechanisms and be able to  use them effectively to develop their own Android applications.
Use development tools, such as those found in the Android Developer&#39;s Toolkit to efficiently create, understand, debug and optimize Android applications.
Understand the key forces and constraints acting on handheld devices and know how to accommodate these when designing and building their own Android applications.
Know where to find additional sources of information to understand and solve Android-related problems.
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.

What resources will I need for this class?
For this course, you&#39;ll need is an Internet connection, a computer on which to run free Android developer tools, and the time to read, write, and discuss.

What is the coolest thing I&#39;ll learn if I take this class?
How to write the software applications that you and half the world are running on your handheld devices.

What computer languages do I need to know?

Some experience with Java should be enough. As mentioned in the Recommended Background Section, those who don&#39;t know Java, but have some familiarity with other languages may want to take a Java tutorial prior to starting this course. 

Can students use programming language, other than Java, for the course?

Not really. The main programming language for Android is Java.  

What should I be reading to prepare for class?
There is no course textbook. If you want to get started early, dive into the Android Developer&#39;s Website


Do I need to buy an Android device? 
No. All the graded exercises will be done using the Android Emulator. 

What is a &quot;trans-institution sequence of MOOCs?&quot; 
This MOOC course and another course tentatively called Pattern-Oriented Software Architectures for Concurrent and Networked Mobile Devices and Clouds, taught by Professors Doug Schmidt and Jules White of Vanderbilt University have been designed to complement each other. In particular, some of the programming assignments and the course project for both courses will be coordinated. The focus of Vanderbilt MOOCs will be systems programming topics, such as server-side Android concurrency, background processing, networking, and computing cloud integration, and will be taught starting in late March 2014. Additional information on our trans-institutional MOOC sequence is available  here and  here. 

Is it necessary to take all the courses in the sequence? 
No. If you just want to take some of the courses in this sequence--or take them all in different order--you&#39;re certainly welcome to do so, and you&#39;ll still learn a lot. However, if you take all the courses in this sequence in the order presented you&#39;ll gain a deeper, end-to-end understanding of handheld systems, their applications and services, as well as their integration into the cloud.

When will the course material be made available each week? 
All the course material (e.g., video lectures, quizzes, short essays, programming assignments, etc.), for each week will be made available at 12:00am eastern time (5am UTC/GMT). each Tuesday of the course.

 How does this MOOC compare/contrast with courses at the University of Maryland? 
This MOOC is heavily based on courses I teach at UMD, called CMSC436, Programming Handheld Systems. The course lecture material is similar, but the quizzes, programming assignments, and level of feedback for the UMD courses are more challenging, given that we have about twice the amount of time to work on it. Also, as the UMD course has many fewer students, there&#39;s significantly more personalized guidance from the professor and TAs that can&#39;t (yet) be replicated via a MOOC. This is one reason why it&#39;s important for students to take on some of the  role of the Instructor. When all of us work together, we all benefit.

Will there be a Statement of Accomplishment for students who complete this class? 
Yes. Students who successfully complete the quizzes and assignments in this class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.  There will be two levels of Statements of Accomplishment: Normal Track and Distinction Track. The difference between these two tracks is that the Distinction Track requires successful completion of the class project. 

What is the most effective way to learn material covered in the course? 
I recommend watching the videos multiple times, looking for different levels of meaning in the diagrams and the examples. Likewise, I recommend reading outside sources of information. Naturally, participating in the online discussion forums (and ideally, a meetup group if one is available in your area) will help make the course material more engaging.

Can students take this course if they have no prior experience with Android programming or programming with Java? 
This course assumes that students are comfortable programming in Java and have some experience programming Android apps. If you don&#39;t have any significant Java programming background, please look on the Internet for one of the many Java-related tutorials that are freely-available.

Will you use Eclipse or Android Studio in this course? 
All of my videos use Eclipse as Android Studio is still in a pre-release state. If you&#39;re using a non-Eclipse development environment, such as AndroidStudio, you may need to enlist the help of other students on the online discussion forum.

Which web browsers are recommended? 
Coursera recommends using the Chrome and Firefox browsers. There&#39;s also a mobile app for Coursera MOOC, as well.

Where can students download the slides that are presented in the videos? 
PDF versions of the slides will be available online as the videos are released.</field>

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Note: The December 2013 offering of this course is 8 weeks of instruction with a 3-week break in the middle, for a total of 11 weeks.

This course is a novice-friendly and delightful introduction to computer science and programming Android-apps for smart-phones and tablets. No prior programming knowledge is necessary. In this course you&#39;ll have fun learning to create an app for modern Android devices such as the Nexus tablet. 

You&#39;ll use the programming tools that Android software developers use and build a complete and useful app during this course. Along the way, we&#39;ll introduce fundamental computer science principles and programming ideas that power today’s smart-phone and tablet apps. 

A reasonably modern and powerful Linux, Windows or Mac-OSX computer is required. A modern Android tablet or phone (such as the approximately USD$199 Nexus 7)  is useful but not-required because you’ll be able to use a virtual device that runs on your computer.
Course Syllabus
This course is composed of 2 basic parts organized into 8 distinct weekly topics:

Android Developer Track (Required. December 2, 2013–January 26, 2014). This required portion of the course is intended to give you a slow and gentle introduction to the basics of Android application development such as downloading, installing, and setting up the tools you will use in this course. You will also create your first Android app and share the results of your experience with your classmates—all without writing hardly any code at all! Passing the Android Developer Track will earn you a Statement of Accomplishment or, if you are participating in the Signature Track, a Verified Certificate.
The weeks of December 23, 2013–January 12, 2014 are during the University of Illinois’ Winter Break. These weeks do not count as part of the 8-week duration of this course, but you are welcome to and encouraged to continue working on the course during this time. Note that it may take longer for course staff to respond during these weeks.
Computer Science and Programming Track (January 27, 2014–February 16, 2014). During this optional, latter portion of the course, you can delve deeper into computer science fundamentals and beginner programming techniques. Together we will explore this content while developing another really cool project to share. Participants who pass this track after also passing the Android Developer Track will earn a separate Illinois badge in addition to (but distinct from) their Statement of Accomplishment or Verified Certificate.
The course is comprised of the following elements:

Lecture videos. Each week your instructor, Lawrence Angrave, will teach you the concepts you need to know through a collection of short video lectures. The lectures include recordings of his computer screen that will guide you step-by-step through each of the main tasks you will complete in the course. You may either stream these videos for playback within the browser by clicking on their titles, or you can download each video for later offline playback by clicking the download icon.
In-lecture questions. Each lecture has questions associated with it to help verify your understanding of the topics. These questions will automatically appear while watching the video if you stream the video through your browser. The questions are available as a separate downloadable text file for those who prefer to download the videos. These questions do not contribute toward your final score in the class.
Quizzes. Each week will include 1 for-credit quiz. You will be allowed 5 attempts at the quiz. Each attempt may present a different selection of questions to you. Your highest score will be used when calculating your final score in the class. There is no time limit on how long you take to complete each attempt at the quiz. There is a deadline for each quiz; however, if you submit a quiz within the first 7 days after the deadline, you can still earn up to 85% of the possible points for the quiz.
Projects. There are multiple projects in this course—2 during the required Android Developer Track and 1 during the optional Computer Science and Programming Track. In these projects, you will create your own apps and share them with the class. Your peers will then evaluate how well your project meets the requirements and provide you with feedback. At the same time, you will review the apps others have made, providing them with feedback while being exposed to a common practice in the industry: peer review. There is no opportunity for late submissions for projects.

	<field name="course_intro">Animal Behaviour and Welfare
Animal welfare has been described as a complex, multi-faceted public policy issue which includes important scientific, ethical, and other dimensions. Improving our understanding of animal welfare, involves the fascinating study of animal behavior as well as the challenge of accessing the emotions of animals.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Animals occupy a huge part of the planet and our lives, and although we rely on them for all aspects of our own wellbeing - food, draught power, medical advances, clothing, sport as well as pleasure, protection and comfort - often their quality of life is questionable. Appreciating how animal&#39;s experience the world they live in and the different behavioural needs of the various species we interact with, enables us to gain a better understanding of their welfare requirements, so that long term improvements to animal lives can be made.  

There are now more than 60 billion land animals raised for meat each year around the world, and with increasing human populations and a rise in meat consumption in many parts of the world, these figures are set to double by 2050. Added to this is a huge and growing world population of dogs and cats, many of whom are strays with associated health and welfare issues.  International concern for animal welfare continues to grow with rising demand for measures to protect animals and improve their care and wellbeing. The link between animal welfare and human wellbeing is clear, and yet we still have a long way to go if we are to address welfare needs globally. Finding ways to achieve higher standards of animal welfare, is therefore a key priority for any developed and developing nation. Due to gaining in importance internationally, there is increasing recognition of the need for animal welfare issues to be addressed objectively in a scientifically credible manner. 

In this animal behaviour and welfare course, you will learn about animal welfare and why it matters, develop an understanding of some of the main welfare issues animals have to cope with as well as gaining an insight into the behavioural needs and the emotions of dogs, cats, farmed animals and captive wildlife.


This course is delivered collaboratively by academics from the University of Edinburgh and Scotland&#39;s Rural College (SRUC).

   

Course Syllabus
Week 1:  Introduction, History, and Concepts of Animal Welfare.

During this week, we will consider what animal welfare is, the meanings and definitions of animal welfare and the history of animal welfare in different parts of the world and how views on animal welfare are influenced by cultural, social, economical, political and other factors.

 

Week 2: Animal Behaviour and Animal Welfare Assessment

Animals show both short-term and long-term behavioural, physiological responses and immunological responses to challenges in their environment. We can use knowledge of animal physiology and both normal and abnormal behaviour as complementary approaches in the assessment of the welfare of an animal in its captive environment. We can also employ experimental techniques to try to understand animal emotions in relation to their living conditions, for example; to determine their preferences, or what they don&#39;t like or find aversive about a  procedure or environment. These experimental techniques allow us to ‘ask’ the animals how they feel about their environment. In week 2 we will explore a variety of techniques used practically and experimentally to provide an insight into the animal’s experience of its world.

 

Week 3: Practical Animal Welfare: Companion Animal Welfare

In many countries dogs and cats are traditionally kept as pets in the home, with stray/abandoned or unwanted animals usually housed in shelters, where there are frequently questions about their behavioural needs. In other parts of the world dogs and cats may exist very successfully as part of a ‘community’ or as ‘street’ animals, and this existence also presents unique challenges and benefits to the welfare of these species. In this lecture we will explore the place of dogs and cats in human society and how different attitudes and management styles impact on their welfare.

 

Week 4: Practical Animal Welfare: Production Animal Welfare

Production animal welfare is a hot topic. In this session you will gain an appreciation of the relevance of farm animal welfare and the issues that impact on production animal species.  We shall also look at the way that scientists have contributed to our understanding of the importance of these impacts from an animal&#39;s point of view. We will explore societal concerns, the scientific understanding of animal welfare within a variety of production methods and how we gain insight to the animal&#39;s viewpoint. 

 

Week 5: Practical Animal Welfare: Captive Wild Animal Welfare

During the fifth week we will summarise key welfare issues relating to the management of captive wild animals in zoos. Primarily conservation-focussed, the zoo community is becoming increasingly aware of the welfare concerns arising from the management of captive wild animals and is developing strategies to address these issues. We will look at the conflicts between welfare and conservation, the methods for assessing welfare within a zoo environment and the challenges associated with this.

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Many of us derive inspiration from watching natural history documentaries and their astounding catalogue of wild animal behaviours.  In this course, we will explore how scientists study animal behaviour, and in particular how behaviour is shaped by the evolutionary forces of natural and sexual selection. Topics include resource acquisition; avoiding enemies; mate choice and sexual conflict; cues, signals and communication; parental care and social behaviour; and the role of genes, environments and learning in regulating behavioural diversity.  We draw on examples from across the animal kingdom to illustrate the complex mechanisms underlying adaptations, and complement these with natural history videos that highlight key concepts. We evaluate the scientific rigour of studies used to test theory, and highlight the often ingenious methods adopted by researchers to understand animal behaviour.

Course Syllabus
We will cover the following topics:
Behaviour, Ecology and Natural Selection
Genes, Environment and Learning
Finding food and avoiding predators
Communication
Sexual selection and sperm competition
Mating systems and sex allocation
Parental care and conflict
Social behaviour
Recommended Background
Apart from enthusiasm for animal behaviour, there is no background required for this course.

Intended Audience
This course will offer a practical approach to prescribing antibiotic therapy and development of antimicrobial stewardship to physicians and pharmacists across all specialties and settings.

Course Description
Antibiotics are among the most frequently prescribed classes of drugs and it is estimated that approximately 50% of antibiotic use, in both the outpatient and inpatient settings, is inappropriate. At the same time, in contrast to any other class of drugs, every antibiotic use has a potential public health consequence – inappropriate use may not harm only the individual patient, but contributes to societal harm by exerting an unnecessary selective pressure that may lead to antibiotic resistance among bacteria. This course will offer a number of illustrative cases, recognizable to the practicing physician in his or her practice to engage the learners in the thought processes that lead to optimal decision making, improved outcomes of individual patients, and harm reduction vis-a-vis the bacterial ecology.

Learning Objectives
Develop skills to apply IDSA guidelines in treating common infections such as acute rhino-sinusitis.
Apply evidence based antibiotic management to treat sepsis.
Implement principles of antimicrobial stewardship when providing care to special populations and in various settings.
Apply evidence based antibiotic management to surgical patients requiring antibiotic prophylaxis.
Apply evidence based antibiotic stewardship program in the outpatient setting.

	<field name="course_intro">Asset Pricing
This course is an introductory survey of graduate-level academic asset pricing. We will focus on building the intuition and deep understanding of how the theory works, how to use it, and how to connect it to empirical facts.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Are you curious about quantitative academic finance? Have you considered graduate study in finance? Are you working in an investment bank, money-management firm or hedge fund and you want to understand models better? Would you like to know what buzzwords like beta, risk premium, risk-neutral price, arbitrage, and discount factor mean? This class is for you. 

We will see how one basic idea, price equals expected discounted payoff, unites everything - models that describe stocks, bonds, options, real investments, discrete time, continuous time, asset pricing, portfolio theory, and so forth. 

We&#39;ll start with the underlying consumption-based model, and we’ll preview the classic issues in finance. We’ll think about asset pricing in a simple economic equilibrium. Then, we&#39;ll take a step back and study contingent claims and the theorems showing the existence of a discount factor (the m in p=E(mx)). We&#39;ll explore the mean-variance frontier and expected return vs. beta models and factor structures. A brief tour of current facts and puzzles follows. Then, off to study options and the Black-Scholes formula, bond pricing models and facts. We will close with modern portfolio theory. 

The math in real finance is not actually that hard. Understanding how to use the equations, and see what they really mean about the world... that&#39;s hard, and that&#39;s what I hope will be uniquely rewarding about this class.
Course Syllabus
Week 0: dz, dt and all that. A Quick Introduction to Continuous Time Stochastic Models

Week 1: Introduction and Overview, Challenging Facts and Basic Consumption-Based Model

Week 2: Classic issues in Finance; Equilibrium, Contingent Claims, Risk-Neutral Probabilities

Week 3: State-Space Representation, Risk Sharing, Aggregation, Existence of a Discount Factor

Week 5: Factor Pricing Models, Value Premium, the Fama-French model 

Week 6: Options and Bonds, Relative Pricing in Action, Term Structure Definitions

Week 7: Term Structure Models

Week 8: Portfolio Theory
Recommended Background
This course uses concepts from finance, undergraduate applied mathematics, advanced undergraduate / beginning graduate level economics, and time-series econometrics. Students should be able to use single and multivariable calculus, simple differential equations, matrix algebra, and basic statistics. They should be able to program simple simulations in a matrix programming language like Matlab, Octave, R, Python, etc. Students should have some background in economics, including utility functions and maximization, and have worked with basic time-series econometrics, such as AR(1) models.
Suggested Readings
The Preface and Chapter 1 of Asset Pricing (Princeton University Press) give a good feel for the class, the range of topics, and the mathematical level. The first two weeks of the class will be based on Chapter 1.
Course Format
• Reading assignments for each week, deriving the theory in detail and also giving intuition and applications.  
• Short lecture videos, emphaszing intuition and interpretation of the results rather than algebraic drudgery. The videos will incorporate integrated quiz questions.

Learn about the origin and evolution of life and the search for life beyond the Earth.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Over two thousand years ago, the ancient Greeks wondered if there were other worlds in the cosmos. This question is now being experimentally tested. This course, offered by the UK Centre for Astrobiology at the University of Edinburgh, is an introduction to astrobiology and was the first MOOC to explore this subject. It explores the origin and evolution of life on the Earth and its potential to exist elsewhere. 

Astrobiology addresses compelling questions of wide interest such as: How did life originate on the Earth? Is this an inevitable process and is life common across the Universe? Astrobiology is an interdisciplinary science that bridges fields as diverse as astrophysics, biology, geosciences and chemistry. 

In this course we will explore what we know about life’s ability to live in extreme environments on the Earth, we will look at different hypotheses for how it originated. We will look at some of the missions to search for life in our own Solar System and on planets orbiting distant stars. We will discuss some of the extreme environments on the Earth that help us understand the limits of life and how life has adapted to cope with extremes. We will explore the possibility of intelligent alien life and some of the implications of its detection. The course will provide a foundation in astrobiology and introduce students to concepts in a diversity of scientific fields.
Course Syllabus
Week 1: What is life and what are the definitions of life? What do we know about the origin of life and what are the current hypotheses for how it originated on the Earth? 
Week 2: What was the environment of early Earth like when life first emerged and what do we know about life on the earliest Earth? How did life evolve to cope with survival in extreme environments? What have been the major evolutionary transitions of life on the Earth?
Week 3: What are the prospects for life on other planetary bodies in our Solar System and how do we go about searching for it? What conditions are required for a planet to be habitable?
Week 4: How do we search for Earth-like planets orbiting distant stars and how would we detect life on them?
Week 5: What are the possibilities for intelligent life elsewhere? How would we deal with contact with an extraterrestrial intelligence and what would be the impact on society? Who would represent Earth?
Recommended Background
No background is required.

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
&quot;How do they know that?&quot; 

Modern astronomy has made some astonishing discoveries - how stars burn and how black holes form; galaxies from the edge of the universe and killer rocks right next door; where the elements come from and how the expanding universe is accelerating. But how do we know all that? The truth is that astronomy would be impossible without technology, and every advance in astronomy is really an advance in technology. But the technology by itself is not enough. We have to apply it critically with a knowledge of physics to unlock the secrets of the Universe. 

Each week we will cover a different aspect of Astronomical technology, matching each piece of technology to a highlight science result.   We will explain how the technology works, how it has allowed us to collect astronomical data, and, with some basic physics, how we the interpret the data to make scientific discoveries.

Learn about ways to assess and teach new and emerging 21st century skills: we cover the nature of these skills, alternative methods of assessment, interpretation and reporting of assessments, and their implications for teaching.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Education and work are changing as a result of technology and its influence in the workplace. We now have new ways of working, new tools for working, new ways of living and even new ways of thinking as a result of the influence of technology on life, work and leisure.

In the workplace, more workers are needed in multi-tasking, information and communications-based employment. Entrants to workplaces need skills to function effectively in this environment that have not traditionally been taught in our schools and universities. In this course, we identify some of these complex skills, and select one to examine in detail - collaborative problem solving - that combines both cognitive and social aspects and requires the ability to use and build knowledge. It is widely regarded by industry as one of the skills lacking in young people and graduates as they struggle to secure stable employment. In some countries the unemployment rates of graduates exceeds 50%. The new skills - often erroneously called soft skills - are not being developed in schools or universities and in many cases when they are, there is uncertainty regarding how to assess and teach them.

In times of great change, when uncertainties dominate thinking about education and work, the result is often a paralysis in education and a reversion to rudimentary approaches to assessment that fail to inform directed learning and teaching. In this course we will focus on the nature of 21st century skills and their assessment, with a link to teaching styles and approaches suitable for a classroom in the 21st century.
Course Syllabus
This course will cover the following;
The influence of technology on the workplace and its potential impact on education
21st century skills defined and a framework of these skills
Assessment methodology for 21st century skills

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
I am pleased to be able to offer free over the Internet a course on Automata Theory, based on the material I have taught periodically at Stanford in the course CS154. Students have access to screencast lecture videos, are given quiz questions, assignments and exams, receive regular feedback on progress, and can participate in a discussion forum. Those who successfully complete the course will receive a statement of accomplishment. You will need a decent Internet connection for accessing course materials, but should be able to watch the videos on your smartphone.

The course covers four broad areas: (1) Finite automata and regular expressions, (2) Context-free grammars, (3) Turing machines and decidability, and (4) the theory of intractability, or NP-complete problems.

Why Study Automata Theory?

This subject is not just for those planning to enter the field of complexity theory, although it is a good place to start if that is your goal. Rather, the course will emphasize those aspects of the theory that people really use in practice. Finite automata, regular expressions, and context-free grammars are ideas that have stood the test of time. They are essential tools for compilers. But more importantly, they are used in many systems that require input that is less general than a full programming language yet more complex than &quot;push this button.&quot;

The concepts of undecidable problems and intractable problems serve a different purpose. Undecidable problems are those for which no computer solution can ever exist, while intractable problems are those for which there is strong evidence that, although they can be solved by a computer, they cannot be solved sufficiently fast that the solution is truly useful in practice. Understanding this theory, and in particular being able to prove that a problem you are facing belongs to one of these classes, allows you to justify taking another approach — simplifying the problem or writing code to approximate the solution, for example.

During the course, I&#39;m going to prove a number of things. The purpose of these proofs is not to torture you or confuse you. Neither are the proofs there because I doubt you would believe me were I merely to state some well-known fact. Rather, understanding how these proofs, especially inductive proofs, work, lets you think more clearly about your own work. I do not advocate proofs that programs are correct, but whenever you attempt something a bit complex, it is good to have in mind the inductive proofs that would be needed to guarantee that what you are doing really works in all cases.
Course Syllabus
Week 1: Finite Automata
Week 2: Regular Expressions and Properties of Regular Languages
Week 3: Context-Free Grammars and Languages
Week 4: Properties of Context-Free Languages, plus introduction to Turing Machines
Week 5: Turing Machines and Undecidability
Week 6: Intractable Problems (NP-Completeness)
Recommended Background
You should have had a second course in Computer Science — one that covers basic data structures (e.g., lists, trees, hashing), and basic algorithms (e.g., tree traversals, recursive programming, big-oh running time). In addition, a course in discrete mathematics covering propositional logic, graphs, and inductive proofs is valuable background.

If you need to review or learn some of these topics, there is a free on-line textbook Foundations of Computer Science, written by Al Aho and me, available at http://i.stanford.edu/~ullman/focs.html. Recommended chapters include 2 (Recursion and Induction), 3 (Running Time of Programs), 5 (Trees), 6 (Lists), 7 (Sets), 9 (Graphs), and 12 (Propositional Logic). You will also find introductions to finite automata, regular expressions, and context-free grammars in Chapters 10 and 11. Reading Chapter 10 would be good preparation for the first week of the course.

The course includes two programming exercises for which a knowledge of Java or Python is required. However, these exercises are optional. You will receive automated feedback, but the results will not be recorded or used to grade the course. So if you are familiar with neither Java nor Python, you can still take the course without concern for prerequisites.

Suggested Readings
The course is built around the material in Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation 3rd edition (2007), by John Hopcroft, Rajeev Motwani, and Jeffrey Ullman, Addison-Wesley. However, you do not have to buy a copy of this book. The course is self-contained, and all homeworks and exams are based solely on concepts taught in the video lectures.
Course Format
3-4 lecture videos each week.  Many of these videos are longer than the typical MOOC video, so feel free to pause them and view them in several sessions of your own choice.

There will be 1-2 problem sets each week, which together count for 50% of the marks.  You can repeat them until you get them all correct, and they are due two Mondays after release of the videos on which they are based.

There are also two optional programming challenges.
FAQ
Will I get a statement of accomplishment after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a statement of accomplishment signed by the instructor.

What is the format of the class?
The class will consist of lecture videos, which are between 15 and 45 minutes in length. These contain integrated quiz questions. There will also be standalone homeworks that are not part of video lectures, optional programming assignments, and a (not optional) final exam.

How much work will I be expected to do in this class?
You need to work about 5-10 hours per week to complete the course. About 2 hours of video segments each week, containing inline ungraded quiz questions. A weekly, graded multiple choice homework.</field>

FAQ
Q: Are there any prerequisites? 
A: No. All you need is a willingness to grow as a writer and communicator.

Q: I really want to learn to correct the mistakes I always make when writing. Is this the class for me? 
A: Yes, but we would like for you to focus on becoming a stronger writer first. If you know how to craft a sentence correctly, you will not be making the same errors AND can free yourself to become a strong communicator.

Q: Who is the intended audience for this course? 
A: We designed this course for the basic writer, a person who would place a couple of classes below English composition at an American college or university. 

Q: I&#39;ve written a novel, have my B.A. in English, and I write a regular blog. Is this class for me? 
A: Maybe. If you want to hone your grammar skills and improve as a writer in the context of a class that includes many different levels of writers, and you are willing to help others improve their writing, then yes. If you are looking for an advanced grammar class, then we encourage you create a discussion group within the course where you may work with individuals of the same interest and skill level. 

Q: Will I learn everything there is to know about grammar in this course?

A: No, but you will learn as much as you need to write a well-written, focused, and detailed paragraph. Throughout the course, we have suggested websites and texts that you can reference for further information about any of the topics covered. Also, you may connect with others who have a similar interest in grammar

Q: Do I need to purchase any textbooks for the course? 
A: No. However, if you would like a book, find a writing reference book that you like to keep on your desk as you continue to develop as a writer! Professor Larry Barkley, one of the faculty for this course, has written a grammar text entitled Grammar and Usage, Naturally available from Cengage. 

Q: Can I get college credit for this course? 
A: No. This course was designed to prepare students for basic writing courses and/or to refresh their skills. However, the completion  of this course may give you credit towards advancing to higher level English courses.  Check with the school you are planning to attend for its recommendation about this issue.

Q: Will I get a statement of accomplishment after taking this course? 
A: Yes. Students who successfully complete this course will receive a statement of accomplishment including a final writing sample from the course.

Q: Can online students ask questions and/or contact the professor? 
A: Yes, but not directly. There are discussion forums within the course where students rank questions and answers. The most important questions and the best answers &quot;bubble&quot; to the top. Teaching staff will monitor these forums, so that important questions not answered by other students can be addressed by faculty.</field>

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
The Music of the Beatles will track the musical development of the band, starting from the earliest days in Liverpool and Hamburg, moving through the excitement of Beatlemania, the rush of psychedelia, and the maturity of Abbey Road. While the focus will be on the music, we will also consider how recording techniques, the music business, the music of other artists, and the culture of the 1960s affected John, Paul, George, and Ringo as they created the Beatles repertory.

There is probably no band or artist that has had more written about their music than the Beatles. There are many good books on the band&#39;s biography, several insider accounts offering glimpses behind the scenes, books that interpret the meaning of the songs, and even books that catalog dates and people regarding the band. This course will try to synthesize much of that information into an account of the Beatles&#39; development as musicians and songwriters.
Course Syllabus
Week One: Early days and success in the UK. The Beatles as pop craftsmen. Study of cover versions at Cavern and Hamburg shows, Please Please Me, With the Beatles, and the singles from this period.

Week Two: Success in America and the world. The Beatles begin to move toward the artist model. Music from  A Hard Day&#39;s Night, Beatles For Sale, and singles from this period. From this point on we will closely follow particular authorship of songs, keeping track of John, Paul, and George as individual songwriters.

Week Three: Pop maturity. Increased experimentation, still mostly within the context of the pop single. The increasingly important role of the recording studio and recording techniques and innovations. Help!, Rubber Soul, and singles from this period.

Week Four: Psychedelia. The artist model comes into full bloom. The rise of importance of the album and idea-driven projects. Revolver, &quot;Penny Lane,&quot; &quot;Strawberry Fields,&quot; Sgt. Pepper, Magical Mystery Tour, and other singles from this period, including the tracks that would end up on Yellow Submarine.

Week Five: A co-op of singer-songwriters. The White Album both begins a return to roots while also continuing the musical experimentation of the earlier music, but now each song is less of a group effort. Creative differences arise.  The White Album and singles from this period.

Week Six: Once there was a way to get back home. The Get Back sessions embrace a return-to-simplicy approach but are aborted. Abbey Road attempts to get back to the band&#39;s previous manner of working. Let It Be combines material from Get Back with newly recorded tracks. Abbey Road, Let It Be, and singles from this period.
Recommended Background
No previous musical training is required. The ability to read music is not required.
Suggested Readings
Primary reference:

William J. Dowlding, Beatlesongs, Touchstone, 1989. A great one-volume account of all the Beatles albums and singles, organized chronologically and in running order, providing song info and Beatle comments. A perfect place to start.

Additional references:

The Beatles Anthology (5-DVD set), Apple, 1995. The Beatles story told as by the band. It is interesting to compare the story as they tell it with the many other band biographies that are out there. There is also a book that provides the full interviews from this project, and this is an excellent resource as well. Other insider accounts are provided by George Martin, Geoff Emerick, Geoffrey Ellis, and Peter Brown, as well as by Brian Epstein in his autobiography (ghost written by Derek Taylor).

Walter Everett, The Beatles As Musicians (two volumes), Oxford University Press, 1999 and 2001. Without question the best books on the technical aspects of the Beatles music available. Highly recommended, especially for those with music training.

Mark Lewissohn, The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions, Sterling, 2013. After years of being out of print, this excellent book on the details of Beatles recording sessions is due to be published in an inexpensive paperback version in October 2013.

Andy Babiuk, Beatles Gear, Backbeat, 2009. For the gearheads out there, this book gives you all the details you need on the guitars, amps, drums, and other gear the band used in the 1960s.

The Beatles Complete Scores, Hal Leonard, 1993. While no knowledge of musical notation is required for this course, if you can read music this is a great resource. This volume transcribes every track recorded by the band and presents it in score format. There are errors, but overall this is a crucial resource for those interested in the technical details of the music.
Course Format
The course will consist of several lecture videos each week; each video will be approximately 10-12 minutes in length, 90 minutes total. Students will be expected to find the music discussed in the lectures, as copyright laws prohibit us from playing music during the lectures. Students are also encouraged to seek out the recommended texts and supplementary materials and read or view the parallel information provided there as we move through the band&#39;s career week by week.
FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.

What resources will I need for this class?
For this course, all you need is an Internet connection, a willingness to seek out the music, and the time to view the lectures, listen to the music, and discuss the Beatles in the online forum.

I have never studied music before.  Can I still take this course?
Yes, absolutely. While there will be musical details discussed, much of the information provided in this course is meant for the general student. Lack of musical training should not impact your ability to perform well on the quizzes.

What is the coolest thing I&#39;ll learn if I take this class?
Studying the music of the Beatles is not only a great way to get to know music you love much more intimately, but it also opens up new ways of listening to and thinking about all the music you care about.</field>

A series of lectures on one of the greatest bodies of music ever composed, from the point of view of a performer. Each lecture will explore a different facet of the music; all will attempt to locate the source of the tremendous psychological power of Beethoven’s music.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Our relationship to Beethoven is a deep and paradoxical one. For many musicians, he represents a kind of holy grail: His music has an intensity, rigor, and profundity which keep us in its thrall, and it is perhaps unequalled in the interpretive, technical, and even spiritual challenges it poses to performers. At the same time, Beethoven’s music is casually familiar to millions of people who do not attend concerts or consider themselves musically inclined. Two hundred years after his death, he is everywhere in the culture, yet still represents its summit.

This course takes an inside-out look at the 32 piano sonatas from the point of view of a performer. Each lecture will focus on one sonata and an aspect of Beethoven’s music exemplified by it. (These might include: the relationship between Beethoven the pianist and Beethoven the composer; the critical role improvisation plays in his highly structured music; his mixing of extremely refined music with rougher elements; and the often surprising ways in which the events of his life influenced his compositional process and the character of the music he was writing.) The course will feature some analysis and historical background, but its perspective is that of a player, not a musicologist. Its main aim is to explore and demystify the work of the performer, even while embracing the eternal mystery of Beethoven’s music itself.

Recommended Background
It is not necessary to have studied an instrument to take this course, or to have any knowledge of music theory. While these may enhance your experience of the course, it is designed for students of all backgrounds with a desire to learn more about Beethoven and his world.
Suggested Readings
There are no pre-requisites for this course. For those who would like to explore the subject from a different perspective, though, there are several terrific studies of Beethoven: 
[Alexander] Thayer’s Life of Beethoven, in two extensive volumes, still, after well over a century, sets the standard for all Beethoven biographies. It is thorough and sober-minded without being dry. It is not the work of a musician, but as a look at the man’s life, it is unmatched. Edited by Elliot Forbes, it is available from the Princeton University Press.
Lewis Lockwood’s Beethoven: The Music and the Life, published in 2005 by Norton, is very different and no less valuable. Far less exhaustive on Beethoven’s biography than Thayer, Lockwood focuses on Beethoven’s musical development, of which he gives a beautiful account – scholarly, but definitely readable by a non-musician.
Beethoven’s own letters are extremely revealing, and often very touching. Beethoven’s mix of pride, stubbornness, and generosity is constantly on display, just as it is in the music. Dover has a collection of 457 of the letters, which touch on matters both mundane (fees for compositions; details of publications) and excruciating (his deafness; his tragic relationship with his nephew).
On a more musicological level, I cannot recommend Charles Rosen’s works highly enough. Those without any musical background will probably find them very thorny. But for anyone who has studied music, both The Classical Style and Sonata Forms (Norton, again) are works of art. The former has a chapter devoted to Beethoven, but really, every word of both books manages to explain how the music of the period works – not merely in an academic manner, but in a way that comes as close to explaining the psychological power of this music as one can in words. Again, not essential as background for the course, but enthusiastically recommended for anyone who wants to go deeper into these pieces.
Of course, the best way to explore Beethoven’s piano sonatas is to listen to them. There are countless great recordings of these works; the complete cycles that I grew up with are those of Artur Schnabel (EMI) and Richard Goode (Nonesuch). They are products of two very different eras, and therefore they collectively form a document of the relationship great musicians have had with Beethoven over the past 100 years.

In the interest of full disclosure, I have written about Beethoven previously, on my website and as a Kindle Single. These writings are not specifically connected to the content of the course; they are more about my own personal relationship with Beethoven and his psychological effect on me, as a performer. 

I am also in the midst of recording the sonatas; the three volumes already released are available from Onyx Classics.

This course will draw heavily on my own research, and pulls largely from my three books: Predictably Irrational (2008), The Upside of Irrationality (2010), and The Honest Truth About Dishonesty (2012). We will examine topics such as our “irrational” patterns of thinking about money and investments, how expectations shape perception, economic and psychological analyses of dishonesty by honest people, how social and financial incentives work together (or against each other) in labor, how self-control comes into play with decision making, and how emotion (rather than cognition) can have a large impact on economic decisions. This highly interdisciplinary course will be relevant to all human beings. 

The goals of this class:
Introduce you to the range of cases where people (consumers, investors, managers, friends, significant others, and even you) might make decisions that are inconsistent with standard economic theory and the assumptions of rational decision making. This is the lens of behavioral economics.
Help you think creatively about the applications of behavioral economics to the development of new products, technologies and public policy, and to understand how business and social policy strategies could be modified with a deeper understanding of the effects these principles have on all of us.

	<field name="course_intro">Introduction to Human Behavioral Genetics
Behavioral genetic methodologies from twin and adoption studies through DNA analysis will be described and applied to address longstanding questions about the origins of individual differences in behavioral traits.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
One of psychology’s defining issues concerns the origins of individual differences in behavior: Why are some people outgoing and cheerful while others are withdrawn and forlorn? Why do some struggle academically while others excel at school despite minimal study? Why do some suffer the ravages of a psychotic illness like schizophrenia while others enjoy a life free of mental illness? At the core to answering these questions is the ages-old &quot;nature-nurture&quot; debate: Are the behavioral differences among us due predominantly to inborn natural differences or the cumulative impact of our experiences? The nature-nurture debate generated much controversy and acrimony within psychology, although today most are willing to retire the debate and declare both sides victorious.

This course provides an introduction to behavioral genetics, the field within psychology that demonstrated that Nature and Nurture both play a fundamental role in the development of psychological traits. We will explore how early behavioral genetic research radically changed how psychologists conceptualized human behavior and how the mapping of the human genome is fundamentally altering current research approaches to a wide range of behavioral characteristics. The course will cover the traditional behavioral genetic methodologies of twin and adoption studies as well as modern approaches based on molecular genetic techniques.

Upon completion of the course, students should have a basic understanding of

how behavioral genetic research has changed psychology’s view of human behavior; 
the strengths and limitations of traditional behavioral genetic methodologies such as twin and adoption studies; 
the behavioral genetic approach to psychiatric phenotypes (to be illustrated by schizophrenia) and psychological phenotypes (to be illustrated by intelligence); and 
the structure and function of the human genome and the prospects for identifying the specific genetic variants underlying individual differences in behavior.

Recommended Background
The course is intended to provide an introduction to the field of behavioral genetics, so minimal background will be assumed.  While students are expected to have an interest in psychology, no prior study of psychology is needed. In terms of background in genetics, high school genetics as well as a basic understanding of some standard genetic terminology (e.g., phenotype, Mendelian inheritance, chromosomes) is expected. An introductory understanding of statistical concepts including correlation, regression, analysis of variance, and statistical significance will be assumed, although the instructor will briefly review most statistical topics the first time they are used in the course.

The course is designed for students who are open-minded, analytical, and willing to confront some of the great controversies that have helped shape psychology. Target audiences include educational professionals interested in incorporating an up-to-date segment on behavioral genetic models and findings into their courses on human behavior; students from the social and biological sciences interested in genetic contributions to behavior but who do not otherwise have access to a behavioral genetics course at their home institutions; and individuals just interested in exploring questions that have perplexed scholars for millennia.

Suggested Readings
Although there will not be a required text for this course, the following is an excellent introductory text for the field:

Plomin, R., DeFries, J. C., Knopik, V. S., &amp; Neiderhiser, J. M. (2013). Behavioral Genetics (6th ed.). New York: Worth Publishers.



Course Format
The class will consist of eight lectures, one per week. Each lecture will be made up of four to eight video modules, with each video module being about 12 - 20 minutes in length. Additionally, most of the video modules will contain one to two multiple choice questions. The purpose of these questions is for students to assess their comprehension of the lecture material. Answers to these questions will not be used in student grading. For each lecture topic there will also be one or two readings, for a maximum of fewer than 15 readings. Unless indicated otherwise, readings can be completed after watching the relevant video clips. Each week, there will be an opportunity to participate in a discussion forum designed to help you reflect on what you are learning and deepen your understanding.

There will be a ten-item multiple choice quiz associated with each of the eight lecture topics. The questions on the quizzes will be drawn roughly 90% from lecture and 10% from the readings. Students will be allowed to take each quiz two times and use the better score as their score for that week&#39;s quiz. The lowest of the eight weekly quiz scores will be dropped. To pass the course, a student must have a total across the remaining seven quizzes of at least 56 points. There will not be a final exam.

In this class you will learn how to conduct a functional behavior assessment (FBA) and apply principles of behavior in the public school classroom in order to promote positive classroom behavior and intervene effectively when faced with challenging behavior.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Teachers in the classroom today have to be equipped with a variety of tools.  Not only do they need to have subject knowledge and the ability to effectively teach, they must also have excellent classroom management skills.  When challenging behavior in the classroom becomes a barrier to instruction, teachers who understand the fundamental principles behind functional behavior assessment (FBA) are prepared to address the behavior before it becomes so disruptive additional resources outside the classroom are needed.   Have you ever had a student who is constantly talking out, getting out of his seat, and disturbing his classmates while you are trying to teach?  No matter how many times you say something to him the behavior persists or gets worse?    You continually ask yourself… Why does David do that? In this course you will learn how to determine “Why?” a student engages in challenging behavior and develop interventions that promote positive behaviors, replacing challenging behavior.

Whether teaching in a general education or special education setting, the key to effective behavior intervention is the functional behavior assessment.   There are various forms of the functional behavior assessment.  We will focus on how teachers can use the direct method of functional behavior assessment as part of their classroom routine.  In this course you will learn how to conduct an FBA.  You will learn how to analyze the FBA to determine the antecedents that set the stage for challenging behavior, and determine the function of the behavior. You will also be able to use what you learn about principles of reinforcement,  to create a function based intervention addressing the antecedents, consequences and promoting replacement behaviors.   What you learn in this course will help you intervene with challenging behaviors in your classroom before they escalate into behaviors that require involvement of additional school faculty and staff beyond your classroom. 

Course Syllabus
Week One: Introduction to Principles of Reinforcement and Punishment including an overview of concepts surrounding positive and negative reinforcement to increase or maintain behavior and punishment to decrease behavior. 

Week Two: Foundations of Functional Behavior Assessment includes a discussion on what constitutes functions of behavior and an introduction to the direct method of functional behavior assessment. 

Week Three:  Conducting and Analyzing the Functional Behavior Assessment where you will learn how to conduct your own functional behavior assessment and analyze the results.

Week Four:  Developing Function Based Intervention Methods includes a discussion of how changes to antecedents and consequences of challenging behavior can be made and how to reinforce replacement behaviors.

How and why was the Bible written? Drawing on the latest archeological research and a wide range of comparative texts, this course synthesizes fascinating recent research in biblical studies and presents a powerful new thesis: Facing catastrophic defeat, the biblical authors created a new form of community—what today we would call &quot;peoplehood.&quot; Their achievements bear directly on modern questions of politics, economics, and theology.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
With its walls razed to ground by Babylon’s armies, Jerusalem joined a long line of ancient vanquished cities—from Ur and Nineveh and Persepolis to Babylon itself. While some recovered from the destruction, others did not.  But none responded to political catastrophe by fashioning the kind of elaborate and enduring monument to their own downfall that we find in the Bible. Most conquered populations viewed their subjugation as a source of shame. They consigned it to oblivion, opting instead to extol the golden ages of the past.  The biblical authors in contrast reacted to loss by composing extensive writings that acknowledge collective failure, reflect deeply upon its causes, and discover thereby a ground for collective hope.  
 
Working through colorful biblical and ancient Near Eastern texts, and drawing on an array of comparative examples, the course illustrates the thoroughgoing manner with which biblical authors responded to defeat by advancing a demotic agenda that places the community at the center. The aim of the biblical authors was to create a nation, and they sought to realize this goal via a shared text, which includes stories and songs, wisdom and laws. This corpus of writings belongs, without a doubt, to humanity’s greatest achievements. Whereas the great civilizations of the Near East invested their energies and resources into monuments of stone that could be destroyed by invading armies, the biblical authors left a literary legacy that has been intensively studied until the present day. More important, these authors’ visionary response to defeat brought to light a radical new wisdom:  the notion that a people is greater than the state which governs it, and that a community can survive collapse when all of its members can claim a piece of the pie and therefore have a reason to take an active part in its collective life. 
 
The objectives of the course are to show: 
—how biblical scholars work with archeological and comparative texts to study the Bible&#39;s formation;
—how the Bible emerged from large-scale corporate crisis and rupture;
—that in our present state of uncertainty and instability we have much to learn from the various strategies the biblical authors adopted to create an enduring “people of the book”;
—that one doesn’t have to believe in God or accept the historicity of the Bible in order to appreciate its profound political messages;
—that the Bible offers modern societies a model for creating communities around a shared collection of texts, songs, and laws;
—and that the Bible itself has a major role to play in our futures.

We have learned a lot recently about how the Universe evolved in 13.7 billion years since the Big Bang.  More than 80% of matter in the Universe is mysterious Dark Matter, which made stars and galaxies to form.  The newly discovered Higgs-boson became frozen into the Universe a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang and brought order to the Universe.  Yet we still do not know how ordinary matter (atoms) survived against total annihilation by Anti-Matter.  The expansion of the Universe started acceleration about 7 billion years ago and the Universe is being ripped apart.  The culprit is Dark Energy, a mysterious energy multiplying in vacuum.  I will present evidence behind these startling discoveries and discuss what we may learn in the near future.

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
The past decade has witnessed the successful of application of many AI techniques used at `web-scale’, on what are popularly referred to as big data platforms based on the map-reduce parallel computing paradigm and associated technologies such as distributed file systems, no-SQL databases and stream computing engines. Online advertising, machine translation, natural language understanding, sentiment mining, personalized medicine, and national security are some examples of such AI-based web-intelligence applications that are already in the public eye. Others, though less apparent, impact the operations of large enterprises from sales and marketing to manufacturing and supply chains. In this course we explore some such applications, the AI/statistical techniques that make them possible, along with parallel implementations using map-reduce and related platforms.

You want to make a difference in the world, and you’re not sure where to begin. You have an idea a day, but are they good ones? How do you turn those ideas into reality?

We have started and sustained commercial, social, artistic, scientific and educational enterprises for most of our adult lives, so we&#39;ve grappled with those same questions. This course will draw heavily from our experience and that of our three world-class guest entrepreneurs who will also share their insights.

The goal of this course is to provide a practical framework for identifying a promising opportunity, assessing its impact, and then developing the idea to a point where it could become a sustainable enterprise. Whether your idea is commercial, artistic, scientific, or social, we’ll give you the specific tools you need to proceed. We’ll cover idea generation, marketing, strategy, financing and the all-important pitch. We’ll introduce you to a “lean start-up” methodology that will help you refine your idea with real-world tests. By the end of the last module you should be prepared to pursue your big idea.

Course Syllabus
We&#39;ve structured the course to cover 6 steps of the entrepreneurial life-cycle, which are thinking, listening, planning, clarifying, supporting, and iterating. Each week will include an assignment designed to help you apply what we teach that week, culminating in a final assignment to synthesize what you&#39;ve learned. A more detailed syllabus will be posted closer to course launch.

Week 1: Think

We start at the beginning with your big idea and where it comes from- your everyday experience and known sources of innovation as described by Peter Drucker.

Week 2: Listen

This second phase of the entrepreneurial life-cycle encourages you to take the big idea you’ve thought about and solicit feedback from the people whose problems you’re trying to solve.

Week 3: Plan

Strategy, the art and science of being different than your competition, is the next element we introduce, based on Michael Porter’s work.

Week 4: Clarify
This week we coach you on continuing to refine your big idea and beginning to communicate it clearly to a wider audience.

Week 5: Support

To make your big idea into a reality, you’ll need the personal, professional, and financial resources we discuss in this module.

Week 6: Iterate

This final step of the entrepreneurial life-cycle outlines a method to continue thinking, listening, planning, clarifying, and supporting your big idea.

	<field name="course_intro">Bioelectricity: A Quantitative Approach
Nerves, the heart, and the brain are electrical. How do these things work? This course presents fundamental principles, described quantitatively.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
In this class you will learn how to think about electrically active tissue in terms of individual mechanisms, and you will learn to analyze the mechanisms quantitatively as well as describe them qualitatively.  The course uses many of the same examples used by Hodgkin and Huxley, who won the Nobel Prize for their experimental unraveling of the mechanisms of the nerve axon of the giant squid, and their creation of a mathematical model of membranes and propagation to understand its function.  That work has been the foundational element of most subsequent understandings of electrically active tissue, whether in nerves, the brain or in muscle, including the heart.

In this course, topics include:

The electrical charging of active membranes from the creation and use of differences in ionic concentrations across the membrane.
The stimulation of the membrane, both naturally and from engineered sources.
The creation of action potentials by the membrane in response to stimulation.
The chain reaction of membrane responses, with each small region or cell initiating an action potential in adjacent ones.
The observation of associated electrical currents in terms of extracellular wave voltages they create, the basis of clinical measurements such as the electrocardiogram.
The course will at each step present equations and other quantitative reasoning so that you will be able to go beyond describing what happens qualitatively and be able to link together the phenomena in the mosaic in a quantitative fashion, which is essential to judging whether specific changes in inputs are important to the outcome. Through the use of quantitative analysis, you will learn that all the elements of the system are tied together and be able to link together and analyze the effects of one part on another.

Course Syllabus
The topics addressed in the course will include:
Electricity in living tissue, “animal electricity,&quot; Galvani and Volta
 Voltages, currents and sources in solutions.  
Electrically active membranes and their resistance and capacitance
Diffusion and fields across membranes, Nernst equilibrium
Ion channels
Action potentials
Impulse propagation, current along the fiber
 Electrical stimulation
Extracellular fields  1,2
Extracellular wave forms
Transmembrane stimulation
 Field stimulation
The goal of the course is to understand an integrated system. That requires understanding the components individually, but the challenge is to understand them working together as an integrated whole.
Recommended Background
Insofar as Bioelectricity, this course begins at the beginning, so all the main ideas can be understood without prerequisite courses.  As electricity is invisible, no one sees it, so the most important prerequisite is one’s willingness to bring imagination, reflection and patience to the topics, so as to allow the ideas to grow and knit together in one’s own mind.

Some of the presentation uses equations and other mathematics that come from calculus and differential equations and other parts reason from the physics of electricity and the analysis of circuits, so background knowledge about these subjects is helpful. For example, one needs to recognize that dV/dt is the rate of change of voltage V with time t, so as to understand that C dV/dt is the current through a capacitor C.  As another example, if V=1/r, what is dV/dr?

A course like this one usually is given to advanced undergraduates or early graduate students in science and engineering, as these students have taken calculus and physics, and differential equations and circuits, and thus are comfortable when notation or simple operations from these fields are used.

Suggested Readings
Reference text (not required): Bioelectricity: A Quantitative Approach
Course Format
The class will consist of lecture videos, which are about 10 minutes in length. Some videos will present new concepts, while others will show numerical calculations using concepts already presented, a kind of video problem session.  Each week there will be two quizzes.  Quiz A, mostly multiple choice, is about core concepts.  Quiz B is more advanced.  Quiz B questions often ask for calculations involving formulas or numbers, but occasionally ask for a short computer program or a brief essay.  At the end of the course, there are two parts of the final exam, similarly divided into A (qualitative) and B (quantitative) sets.  

FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor. A statement of accomplishment reflecting qualitative accomplishment is given on the basis of quiz A and exam A responses alone. A higher-level statement of accomplishment is given based on combined A (qualitative) and B (quantitative) scores.

What resources will I need for this class?
You should have access to a computer to put numbers into equations and get numerical results.

Does the class require computer programming?
There are no complex programming assignments, but there are relatively simple ones within questions in the B quizzes. Some calculations have to be performed cyclically for a few dozen cycles, so one has to be able to write programs that can accomplish such repetition. Examples are given with C++ or Python statements.

Will I learn how to perform medical tests such as taking an ECG, and will I learn how these are interpreted?
No. However, you will learn some fundamentals about what is measured, and where it comes from.

Does this course include presentation and use of the Hodgkin-Huxley equations for nerves?
Yes, as these equations are the foundation for most present-day understanding of electrically excitable membrane. They also illustrate how greatly biology, sometimes considered limited to qualitative descriptions, has become a precise, quantitative subject.

Is this class hard?
No and yes. In this class about a dozen basic ideas are put together into combinations that produce remarkable outcomes. No, it is not a subject where any one idea or any one step is especially difficult. Yes, it is a subject (and thus a class) that requires reflection and assembly into your own mind of how these ideas relate to each other in combination. As in gardening, you cannot make these ideas grow: you have to plant them with care and let them grow.

What is the coolest thing I&#39;ll learn if I take this class?
How a battery can be in salt water for 100 years, used over and over, and yet never discharge.</field>

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
The sequencing of the human genome a decade ago fueled a computational revolution in biology, which has arguably been an impetus for more new algorithms than any other fundamental realm of science.  The newly formed links between computer science and biology affect the way we teach applied algorithms are taught to computer scientists.

Genome sequencing is just one of hundreds of biological problems that have become inextricable from the computational methods required to solve them. In this course, we will uncover some of the algorithmic ideas that are fundamental to an understanding of modern biology.  Computational concepts like dynamic programming and graph theory will help us explore algorithms applied to a wide range of biological topics, from finding regulatory motifs to determining whether the human genome has &quot;fragile&quot; regions.  Throughout the process, we will apply real bioinformatics algorithms to real genetic data.

We have created an interactive textbook for this course, which allows you to learn and solve problems concurrently.  This textbook is currently hosted on Stepic.

Course Syllabus
Each homework assignment will contain 5-10 programming assignments.

The course will be based around the following central questions, with the algorithmic ideas that we will use to solve them in parentheses:
Where Does DNA Replication Begin? (Algorithmic Warm-up)
How Do We Sequence Antibiotics? (Brute Force Algorithms)
Which DNA Patterns Act As Cellular Clocks? (Greedy and Randomized Algorithms)
How Do We Assemble Genomes? (Graph Algorithms)
How Do We Compare Biological Sequences? (Dynamic Programming Algorithms)
Are There Fragile Regions in the Human Genome? (Combinatorial Algorithms)
Bioinformatics Algorithms (Part 2) will cover: read mapping, gene expression analysis, evolutionary tree reconstruction, computational aspects of human genetics, computational proteomics, and network biology.
Recommended Background

Blended learning is a new educational model with great potential to increase student outcomes and create exciting new roles for teachers. In this course you will learn about the different types of blended learning and the best practices from real schools using these models. In addition, you will develop the tools you need to build your own blended learning program.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Plenty of buzz exists about blended learning and its transformational potential. But what does blended learning really mean? In this course we will explore the different models of blended learning and dive into key issues that impact students, teachers, and schools. Specifically, we will look at these issues through the lens of three high-performing schools that each use a different type of blended learning.  A few of the key topics will include:

The role of the student and how to support students in the transition from traditional to blended learning
Implications for teachers in their day-to-day work and overall role
Impact on the way schools are designed including staffing models, use of time, hardware/software selection, and the use of data
Implementation challenges, potential solutions, and the remaining open questions
We will live by the attributes of blended learning in this course, encouraging students to take quizzes at the beginning of the week to assess their understanding and skip material they already know.  In addition, the course will culminate in participants prototyping their own blended learning model and will have an overall hands-on approach. 

If you are interested in learning more about how to best leverage technology in education and rethink the way we run schools, join this MOOC and encourage your colleagues to do the same.  Become a part of this growing movement and learn first-hand how blended learning can help provide students a more personalized learning experience.  Consider signing up for the signature track so you can have a verified certificate of your completion of this course.

Course Syllabus
&quot;Blended Learning:  Personalizing Education for Students&quot;  explores the definition of blended learning and how to implement high-quality blended learning models.  The topics covered in the course include:
The definition of blended learning and several blended learning models
The role of the student and how to support students in the transition from traditional to blended learning
The role of the teacher and blended learning&#39;s implications for teachers in their day-to-day work and overall role
The impact of blended learning on the way schools are designed including staffing models and use of time
The selection of appropriate hardware and software in blended learning models and the use of space and the design of facilities
A process for innovation and continuous improvement in blended learning models

Recommended Background
This course is designed for anyone with a strong interest in blended learning.  We anticipate participation from educators as well as parents and members of the education technology sector, philanthropy, non-profits, etc.  That said, it is ideal to have some access to some form of a classroom (a friend, colleague, after school program, etc.) to take the most advantage of the course because we strongly believe in people being able to try out these ideas.  That said, there are pathways in the course for people who have access to a classroom and those who do not.

FAQ
Will I get a statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?

Yes.  Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.  The signature track will also be available for this class.  Signature track is a great opportunity to earn a verified certificate for your completion of this course - it links your coursework securely to your real identity and allows you to share your electronic course record with employers or anyone else through a unique, secure URL.

Do I need to be a classroom teacher to participate?

No.  This course is designed for anyone with a strong interest in blended learning.  We anticipate participants from the education technology sector, philanthropy, non-profits, parents, etc. also participating.  That said, it is ideal to have some access to some form of a classroom (a friend, colleague, after school program, etc.) to take the most advantage of the course because we strongly believe in people being able to try out these ideas.  That said, there are pathways in the course for people who have access to a classroom and those who do not.

What is different about this course than any other professional development about education technology?

This course is focused on the potential of blended learning to transform the way we setup classrooms and schools.  We are not focused on simply putting computers into classrooms or layering technology on top of the existing system.  This course focuses on the highest-quality blended learning we have seen so far, and schools that are working to get closer to the golden ideal of every student getting exactly what they need, when they need it.  We’ll cover the basics of blended learning and then move quickly into all the implications for the role of the student, the role of the teacher, and the implications for how we design and run our schools. 

Can I take the course with a friend or colleagues?

Definitely.  Several schools are forming groups of colleagues, each signed up for the course, to work through the material and learn together.  At minimum, we encourage you to email a friend or two as the social elements of learning have a strong impact on completion and enthusiasm for learning in the online setting.  We also hope to cultivate a robust community forum during the course – which all experience tells us can be one of the most useful and dynamic elements of online learning.  But like any learning, you’ll get out of it what you put into it.  So we encourage folks to be fired up about their learning, try out the ideas we are learning themselves, and then create posts, videos, etc. so that we can all learn from each other.  It is the “early innings” of this movement, and you as participants can really help shape the future of blended learning.</field>

You will become intimately acquainted with the operational principles of neuronal “life-ware” (synapses, neurons and the networks that they form) as well as with recent ideas about how the dynamics of these networks generate the “neuronal code.” As an aperitif we will highlight present brain-excitements and for dessert we will discuss the future of brain research</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Probably the greatest challenge of the “21st century of the brain” is to understand how subcellular and cellular neuronal processes give rise to behavior – movement, perception, emotions, memory and creativity. This course will discuss, step-by-step, how modern molecular, optical, electrical, anatomical and theoretical methods have provided fascinating insights into the operation of the elementary building blocks of brains and, most importantly, how neuronal mechanisms underlie memory and learning processes. We will next discuss why computer simulations are so essential for understanding both neuronal “life ware” and the emergence of networks dynamics (e.g., as in the “Blue Brain Project”). 

The course will start by highlighting a few recent brain-excitements, including treating the sick brain via electrical stimulation, recent attempts at “reading the brain code” for brain-machine interfaces, new neuro-anatomical techniques (“Brainbow” and connectomics) and physiological methods (optogenetics) that enables us to record/activate the living, behaving brain at single cell resolution. We will end by discussing emerging frontiers in brain research, including the interaction between brain research and the arts. As an added bonus, a lecture on perception, action, cognition and emotions will be taught by an acclaimed neuroscientists, Prof. Israel Nelken..

	<field name="course_intro">The Brain and Space
This course is about how the brain creates our sense of spatial location from a variety of sensory and motor sources, and how this spatial sense in turn shapes our cognitive abilities.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Knowing where things are is effortless.  But “under the hood,” your brain devotes a tremendous amount of computational power to figuring out even the simplest of details about the world around you and your position in it.  Recognizing your mother, finding your phone, going to the grocery store, playing the banjo – these require careful sleuthing and coordination across different sensory and motor domains.  This course traces the brain’s detective work to create this sense of space and argues that the brain’s spatial focus permeates our cognitive abilities, affecting the way we think and remember.

The material in this course is based on a book I&#39;ve written for a general audience.  The book is called &quot;Making Space: How the Brain Knows Where Things Are&quot;, and is available for pre-order.

The course material overlaps with classes on perception or systems neuroscience, and can be taken either before or after such classes.

Course Syllabus
1. Vision (Week 1-2)
Seeing: from the brain’s molecular light switches to a world in depth

This unit explains what light is, and how it is detected by photoreceptors in the eye.  It includes a history of vision research dating back to ancient Greece, and describes the role of the astronomer Kepler in deducing how the image of the visual scene is formed on the eye.  How the two-dimensional projection of the visual scene onto the surface of the retina is interpreted by the brain as a three-dimensional world is explored through examples from various artists such as Magritte and Escher.

2. Somatosensory (Week 2)
Body sense:  Measuring and mismeasuring your own shape, and why negative numbers are hard (for your brain)

This unit covers how we know about the positions of the parts of our bodies.  Some intriguing illusions of body position sense are covered.  The combination of body position sense and our sense of touch yields a sense of the three-dimensional location and shape of solid objects. 

3. Brain maps (Week 3)
Brain maps and polka dots

This unit introduces the brain mechanisms responsible for sensory processing of vision and touch, with an emphasis on the formation of sensory maps in the visual and somatosensory pathways of the brain.  The implications of these maps and other neural response properties for perception of spatial location are explored, with an emphasis on object motion and contours.  Experiments using electrical stimulation in sensory maps to probe their connection to perception are discussed. 

4. Auditory (Week 4)
Sherlock ear: how your brain finds sounds

This unit turns to a sensory system for which spatial location must be inferred from indirect measurements.  For vision and touch, the sensory receptors are able to measure spatial location in kind:  objects at different locations activated different sensory receptors.  For hearing, the brain must compare and contrast the sounds arriving at each ear to make inferences about the location of origin.  This unit discusses the how this works, from the nature of sound itself to the interpretation of location-dependent sound attributes by the brain.

5. Brain meters for space (Week 4)
Moving with maps and meters

This unit introduces the concept of a “meter” for spatial signals in the brain.  More commonly but somewhat obscurely referred to as rate coding, this kind of representation involves neural response rates that scale in proportion to spatial location – a meter whose level indicates position. This kind of code is used in movements, the sense of body position, and in the early stages of the auditory pathway.  

6. Reference frames (Week 5)
Defining space: reference frames

Spatial locations are measured with respect to reference positions, but these reference positions differ depending on the type of sensory input.  The eyes measure locations with respect to the eyes, and the ears measure locations with respect to the ears.  This unit discusses some illusions related to this issue and describes brain mechanisms for translating between different reference frames.  Synthesizing a sense of space across time as the body and its sense organs move through the environment requires integrating memories of the sensory input at different times and positions.

7. Navigation (Week 5)
Going places: Balance, flow, steps and shortcuts

This unit shifts focus in two ways:  (a) it involves space on a larger scale such as traveling from one place to another, and (b) it involves a sense of one’s own position in the environment as opposed to the position of objects or events in that scene.  The role of the sense of balance and one’s own movements are incorporated.  Animal species that navigate long distances and how they do this are described. 

8. Space and memory (Week 6)
How the brain&#39;s spatial systems provide a framework for remembering, and vice versa

This unit builds the first of several important links between the sense of space and other kinds of cognition.  Memory is closely linked to spatial processing at several levels.  This unit discusses the role of the hippocampus in both navigation and memory, and tells the story of patient HM, whose hippocampus was surgically destroyed in the 1950’s, resulting in lifelong amnesia.

9. Thinking spatially (Week 6)
How the brain&#39;s spatial systems provide a framework for thinking

This unit argues that the space-sensitive regions of the brain do much more than evaluate location.  Instead, these areas are recruited for cognitive processes such as paying attention, making decisions, and planning future actions.  The kinds of computations that the brain performs on spatial inputs may resemble the kinds of computations that the brain performs on abstract concepts and ideas.  Thinking about space and more general kinds of thinking may involve similar brain mechanisms.

FAQ
What do you mean by &quot;space?&quot;  Sounds like rocket science.

No - I mean spatial locations - spatial locations of all kinds of things and all kinds of scales, ranging from how your brain can detect the shape of these letters on the screen to how you know the position of your limbs to how you remember how to get to the grocery store.

What cool stuff will I learn?

You&#39;ll learn how your eyes are like radios, how your ears tell time, and how tiny rocks in your head help you tell which way is up.  You&#39;ll learn how you know where you are, how you get from one place to another, and why you might take a shortcut to come back.  You&#39;ll learn why it’s harder to remember how to get somewhere if you’ve always been the passenger than if you have driven that way yourself.  You&#39;ll learn why, when you set off to do something and then forget what you are up to, going back to the place where you started might help you remember.

Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.

Is Signature Track available?

Yes it is!  

What resources will I need for this class?

	<field name="course_intro">The Brain-Targeted Teaching® Model for 21st Century Schools
Improve the outcomes in your classroom through practical applications of neuro- and cognitive science research.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
New findings from the neuro- and cognitive sciences have the potential to inform classroom instruction and influence educational practices for children at all developmental levels.  Translating this research to practice, however, is often challenging for educational practitioners.  This course will offer practical application of research by linking it with the Brain-Targeted Teaching® Model (BTT)—a pedagogical framework for using research in the neuro- and cognitive sciences as well as research-based effective instruction to guide teachers in planning, implementing, and assessing a sound program of instruction for all learners. 

Participants in the course will examine research from the brain sciences that can inform educational practice and be able to implement research findings using the instructional framework, The Brain-Targeted Teaching® Model. This model presents six stages, or “brain targets” of the teaching and learning process. The components include (1) establishing the emotional climate for learning, (2) creating the physical learning environment, (3) designing the learning experience, (4) teaching for the mastery of content, skills, and concepts, (5) teaching for the extension and application of knowledge, and (6) evaluating learning. A central theme of the model is the integration of the arts to foster retention of new information, conceptual development, and higher-order thinking and creative problem-solving.

Course objectives:

Describe themes in brain research that can inform educational practice consistent with the Brain-Targeted Teaching® Model.
Describe how emotional and physical learning environments affect learning.
Identify themes in brain research that educators can apply as they design instruction; teach for mastery of content, skills, and processes; design activities to apply and extend knowledge; and evaluate learning.
Course Syllabus
Sessions 1 &amp; 2:  Course overview; Introduction to the science of learning and the Brain-Targeted Teaching® Model; ABCs of brain anatomy; BTT Learning Unit
The professional development content will begin with an overview of the major themes in the new study of the science of learning. A variety of “neuro-myths” will be described (e.g. brain development is complete by age 3). The Brain-Targeted Teaching® Model will be introduced, and the six brain targets will be briefly described.
Basic information about brain anatomy and cognitive functions will be presented as foundational knowledge. 
Sessions 3 &amp; 4:  The Emotional Climate for Learning
This session will focus on strategies to create a positive emotional climate in classrooms–an environment in which students feel connected to school and motivated to learn. Through presentations, video, and simulation activities, participants will learn techniques as well as underlying research that support promoting an emotional connection to content to increase motivation for learning. Examples include classroom routines and rituals, specific praise techniques, ways to disengage and redirect aberrant behaviors, and strategies that engage students emotionally in content.
Sessions 5 &amp; 6: The Physical Learning Environment; The Learning Unit Design

Content will include how environmental factors influence attention learning consistent with the tenets of BT-2. Participants will brainstorm ways to use novelty and environmental factors such as lighting, sound, scent, and movement to promote student attending behaviors.
Participants will identify ways they can change classrooms to align with creating a stimulating environment that supports students’ attending behaviors and engagement in learning.
Participants will review underlying research associated with the cognitive processes of patterning and “big picture thinking” and will be able to articulate how concept mapping improves understanding and retention of content (BT-3).
Participants will design concept maps and graphic organizers to be used as the foundation for planning learning units to promote global understanding of key lesson topics and objectives. They will use Common Core State Standards to design learning units that include all components of BTT, including activities to reinforce content through arts and technology integration. 
Session 7 &amp; 8: The Learning Unit Design; Teaching for Mastery of Content, Skills, and Concepts
Participants will engage in an in-depth examination of the research and best practices associated with BT-4-- Teaching for Mastery. A wide array of research findings related to memory will be presented, and practical implications for the classroom will be described. The important role of arts integration in reinforcing memory for content will be outlined, as will the possibility of “transfer” from arts to non-arts domains. Technology innovations will also be discussed as a way to reinforce classroom objectives.
Participants will complete the BTT planning guide to describe and implement BT-4 activities. Participants will reflect on how the activities enhanced instructional practice.
Sessions 9 &amp; 10: Teaching for Mastery of Content, Skills, and Concepts; Teaching for the Application of Knowledge in Creative Problem-Solving Activities
Participants will be presented with research and best practices associated with BT-5--Teaching for the Application of Knowledge. The presentation will include research on executive function and the cognitive processes of creative and divergent thinking. Through simulated activities, participants will explore ways that creativity is important for the kind of real-world problem solving that is important for preparing students to be college and career ready.
Participants will be able to design and use instructional strategies that promote rigor and deep understand of content through the application and extension of knowledge in real-world learning activities. They will extend students’ mastery of content by designing activities delivered in the BTT learning unit that require higher-order thinking, divergent thinking skills, and problem-solving in authentic learning tasks.
Sessions 11 &amp; 12: Teaching for the Application of Knowledge in Creative Problem-Solving Activities; Evaluation Learning
Participants will be able to use effective and appropriate techniques for evaluating students’ learning throughout each BTT learning unit. Evaluation is considered not only as a means of measuring student progress, but also as a tool for increasing learning.
Research will describe how feedback, active retrieval of information, and spacing of learning events influence both learning and retention of information. Through demonstrations and simulated activities, participants will explore the use of multiple probes to evaluate learning including performance assessment, student portfolios and reflective journals. They will be able to use assessment data to modify learning activities. 
Sessions 13 &amp; 14: Evaluating Learning; The BTT Learning Unit
Demonstration of BTT Learning Units: During this session, expert teachers who have designed learning units will demonstrate their field-tested BTT learning units. These expert teachers will present the process of learning unit design and assist participants in designing their own units. Techniques for arts integration will be demonstrated.    
Session 15: Presentation of Learning Units
Individuals and/or collaborative teams will have developed and field-tested BTT learning units, including instructional activities and evaluations.
Each participant will be expected to turn in a learning unit and a PowerPoint presentation describing the unit, the implementation process, and student outcomes.
Participants will have the option of providing feedback to other participants. Participants have the option of publishing their units on the BTT website.

Course Syllabus
The course is divided into five &quot;chapters&quot;: 

CHAPTER 1: Functions 
After a brief review of the basics, we will dive into Taylor series as a way of working with and approximating complicated functions. The chapter will use a series-based approach to understanding limits and asymptotics. 

CHAPTER 2: Differentiation 
Though you already know how to differentiate some functions, you may not know what differentiation means. This chapter will emphasize conceptual understanding and applications of derivatives. 

CHAPTER 3: Integration 
We will use the indefinite integral (an anti-derivative) as a motivation to look at differential equations in applications ranging from population models to linguistics to coupled oscillators. Techniques of integration up to and including computer-assisted methods will lead to Riemann sums and the definite integral. 

CHAPTER 4: Applications 
We will get busy in this chapter with applications of the definite integral to problems in geometry, physics, economics, biology, probability, and more. You will learn how to solve a wide array of problems using a consistent conceptual approach. 

CHAPTER 5: Discretization 
Having covered Calculus for functions with a single real input and a single real output, we turn to functions with a discrete input and a real output: sequences. We will re-develop all of Calculus (limits, derivatives, integrals, differential equations) in this new context, and return to the beginning of the course with a deeper consideration of Taylor series. 
Recommended Background
Students are expected to have prior exposure to Calculus at the high-school (e.g., AP Calculus AB) level. It will be assumed that students:

are familiar with transcendental functions (exp, ln, sin, cos, tan, etc.);
are able to compute very simple limits, derivatives, and integrals;
have seen slope and area interpretations of derivatives and integrals respectively.
This material will be reviewed; however, it is important to begin the course with some background. A diagnostic exam will be made available to help you gauge your preparedness. 

The course will serve equally well as a first university-level course in Calculus or as a review from a novel perspective.

If you&#39;ve never seen Calculus before, this is likely not the course for you. Please see, e.g., the more introductory course from Ohio State University:  https://www.coursera.org/course/calc1

If you are looking for the background needed to begin a study of Calculus, please see, e.g., the pre-Calculus course by UC Irvine: https://www.coursera.org/course/precalculus

Suggested Readings
There is a fun picture-book available that gives the main ideas of the course: 

R. Ghrist [2012], FLCT: the Funny Little Calculus Text 

You can preview the entire book for free or download a copy through  google play. This is a supplemental text only and is not required for the course...but it might make you laugh.
Course Format
The class will consist of nearly 60 animated lecture videos, each about 15 minutes in length. The schedule will be approximately 5 quarter-hour lectures per week over 13 weeks. Occasional &quot;bonus&quot; lectures will provide more advanced or off-the-syllabus perspectives. You will get to practice your skills with lots of homework problems. These will not count towards your grade for the course, but, because of this, there will be open forums for discussing how to solve the homework problems. Grading will be based on graded chapter quizzes (5), and a final exam.
FAQ
Will I get some kind of Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor. If you sign up for the &quot;Signature Track&quot;, then you have the opportunity to earn a verified Certificate.

What is the format of the class?
The class will consist of lecture videos, usually about fifteen minutes each. There will be homework problems that are not part of video lectures. There will be approximately seventy-five minutes worth of video content per week. The lectures are fairly dense: you will want to budget enough time to allow for repeated viewings, especially when working through the homework assignments.

Will the text of the lectures be available?
We are building a detailed course wiki which mirrors the lectures closely; also, the videos will have subtitles. In other words, you do not need to take detailed notes of the lecture -- it&#39;s already been done for you.

Is this a hard course?
Yes. Let me repeat: YES. This course is a faithful representation of the depth and difficulty of Penn&#39;s MATH 104, a course that many of our best students find to be a challenge. Calculus, like the rest of Mathematics, takes time and effort to master. If you are prepared to work hard at the assignments, I&#39;ll work hard to explain the principles as clearly as possible.

Do I need a graphing calculator or special mathematical software? No! This course will emphasize conceptual understanding and applications. All the computations should be done using a pencil, eraser, paper, and your brain, though not necessarily in that order of importance.
Does this course cover all of Calculus?

No. It will be assumed that you&#39;ve seen some of the subject, at a high-school equivalent level (e.g., at the level of the Calculus AB exam). In addition, we will cover only single-variable calculus, not multi-variable.

How do I connect with this course on social media?
You can join Calculus: Single Variable&#39;s student community on Facebook, follow the course on Twitter, or add it on Google+ to connect with your fellow classmates outside of the discussion boards.

Course in French with English subtitles -- Ce cours introduit à la vie et à la pensée du réformateur Jean Calvin (1509-1564) ainsi qu’à son influence sur le monde moderne et contemporain. La démarche proposée se veut critique, il ne s’agit ni de canoniser ni de condamner Calvin, mais de comprendre sa pensée avec toute la distance requise et d’en analyser les enjeux. -- This course is an introduction to the life and thought of the reformer John Calvin (1509-1564) and to his influence on the modern and contemporary world. The approach we develop is critical: we intend neither to canonize nor to condemn Calvin or his thought. Our goal, rather, is to avoid any rash evaluation in order to understand his thought and analyze the issues at stake in it.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Qui était Jean Calvin ? Pourquoi ses idées ont-elles exercé une telle influence au 16e siècle et dans les siècles suivants ? Ce cours cherchera à répondre à ces deux questions. 
Il mettra en évidence l’humanisme de Calvin, sa compréhension de la pensée biblique, son acuité théologique, son sens aigu des problèmes sociaux et politiques. Nous aurons aussi l’occasion d’évoquer l’apport de Calvin à la culture (notamment à la langue française, qui lui doit considérablement) et à la conception de l’humain devant Dieu et dans la société. Nous verrons également comment Calvin fit de Genève la capitale d’une idée et d’un idéal de vie chrétienne, en pensant le rapport au travail et à l’argent ou en créant des institutions comme la Compagnie des pasteurs, le Consistoire et l’Académie. 
Ce cours mettra également en évidence la place que Calvin occupe dans l’histoire de la tolérance, ou plutôt de l’intolérance, religieuse : l’affaire Servet (du nom de ce savant espagnol condamné à mort à Genève pour hérésie) fera ainsi l’objet d’une analyse spécifique. Nous tenterons également de montrer les apports de la théologie de Calvin (notamment la compréhension renouvelée d’un Dieu en qui l’humain peut faire confiance) et ses limites (par exemple la doctrine dite de la prédestination). 
Ce cours d’introduction fera également une place à l’histoire du calvinisme en Europe (France, Allemagne, Provinces-Unies, Angleterre) et dans le monde (Amérique, Afrique du Sud, Asie). 
Le cours est donné en français avec sous-titres en anglais.

Who was John Calvin? Why were his ideas so influential in the 16th century and well beyond his time? This course seeks to answer these two questions. 
We will present his humanistic leanings, his interpretation of the Bible, his theological vision, his acute sense of social and political questions. We will consider his contribution to culture, how he contributed to shaping French language, his understanding of the human before God and in society. The course will address how Calvin sought to transform the city of Geneva into an idea and an ideal of Christian life, by thinking the meaning of work and money, but also by creating educational and ecclesiastical institutions (the « Company of Pastors », the « Consistory » and the « Academy »). 
The course will locate Calvin within the history of religious toleration, or rather of religious intolerance. We will analyse the fate of Michel Servet, a learned Spanish man who was condemned for heresy and executed in Geneva in 1553. With regard to Calvin’s theology, we will show both his lasting contribution (especially his understanding of a God in whom one may trust) as well as the limitations of his thought (for instance his doctrine of predestination). 
Towards the end of this introductory course, we will turn our attention to the history of Calvinism in Europe (France, Germany, the United Provinces, England) and in various parts of the world (Americas, South Africa and Asia).

However, every one of you will have different needs and different circumstances, and some exercises may be more beneficial for you than others. We will try to explain what each activity could do for you and we encourage you to select the exercises that seem most useful to you personally.
Do I have to complete the course in the order specified?
No. We have structured the course as a series of topics over six weeks and we have tried to order the topics so that subsequent weeks build on the learning of previous weeks. However, depending on your experience, personality and self-awareness, you may not need to complete earlier weeks to get the best out of later weeks. So, feel free to follow it through step by step, but also feel free to jump in wherever seems most appropriate.

This course will provide the scientific basis for caries (dental decay) risk assessment and practice interventions. You will immediately be able to apply “caries management by risk assessment” into your clinical setting or into your personal health care.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Dental Caries (tooth decay) is a bacterially based disease that progresses when acid produced by bacterial action on dietary fermentable carbohydrates travels into the tooth and dissolves the carbonated hydroxyapatite mineral.  This process is called demineralization.

Pathological factors, including acidogenic bacteria, salivary dysfunction, and dietary carbohydrates are related to caries progression.  Protective factors, which include antibacterials, salivary calcium, phosphate and proteins, salivary flow, and fluoride in saliva can balance, prevent or reverse dental caries through a process of remineralization.  Remineralization is a natural and reliable repair mechanism for non-cavitated carious lesions.

This course will provide the scientific basis behind the “caries balance” concept, which is the key to caries management by risk assessment in clinical practice.  If pathological factors prevail caries progresses.  If protective factors prevail the caries process is halted or reversed.

The course will present tools to implement  CAMBRA, “caries management by risk assessment,” in your clinical setting.  It can be in implemented medical and dental settings, and can benefit children and adults of all ages. Implementation in dental practice provides patients with genuine hope and success for the management of their oral health.  It is a practice builder for dentistry.

	<field name="course_intro">Case-Based Introduction to Biostatistics
Learn to frame and address health-related questions using modern biostatistics ideas and methods.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
The course objective is to enable each student to enhance his or her quantitative scientific reasoning about problems related to human health. Biostatistics is about quantitative approaches - ideas and skills - to address bioscience and health problems. To achieve mastery of biostatistics skills, a student must “see one, do one, teach one.” Therefore, the course is organized to promote regular practice of new ideas and methods. 

The course is organized into 3 self-contained modules. Each module except the first is built around an important health problem. The first module reviews the scientific method and the role of experimentation and observation to generate data, or evidence, relevant to selecting among competing hypotheses about the natural world. Bayes theorem is used to quantify the concept of evidence. Then, we will discuss what is meant by the notion of “cause.” 
  
In the second module, we use a national survey dataset to estimate the costs of smoking and smoking-caused disease in American society. The concepts of point and interval estimation are introduced. Students will master the use of confidence intervals to draw inferences about population means and differences of means. They will use stratification and weighted averages to compare subgroups that are otherwise similar in an attempt to estimate the effects of smoking and smoking-caused diseases on medical expenditures. 

In the final module, we will study what factors influence child-survival in Nepal using data from the Nepal Nutritional Intervention Study Sarlahi or NNIPPS. Students will estimate and obtain confidence intervals for infant survival rates, relative rates and odds ratios within strata defined by gestational period, singleton vs twin births, and parental characteristics.
Recommended Background
Interest in the scientific method as broadly related to human health. Ability to reason precisely. Mathematics through pre-calculus.
Course Format
For each module, students will complete a set of practice problems and then one or two graded quizzes to demonstrate their mastery of the ideas and methods taught in the module. Material will be introduced via 10-15 minute videos. Self-evaluation questions will be available for students to test their understanding of the material. Students will be encouraged to participate in on-line discussions to answer questions about the main ideas and methods.

	<field name="course_intro">Measuring Causal Effects in the Social Sciences
How can we know if the differences in wages between men and women are caused by discrimination or differences in background characteristics? In this course we look at causal effects as opposed to spurious relationships. We will discuss how they can be identified in the social sciences using quantitative data, and describe how this can help us understand social mechanisms.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
In this course we discuss how to identify causal effect in the social sciences. Causal effects are interesting whenever we want to understand mechanisms. 

As an example we can think of the case of wage differentials across gender. This may be due to either discrimination from employers or differences in unobserved background characteristics across gender. Usually we would like to think about discrimination as a mechanism whereas differences in background characteristics would usually not been seen as a mechanism. So it may be important to be able to tell why there is pay differences across gender.

To show causal effects the provision of a statistical relationship is not enough.  The fundamental problem in identifying causal effects is therefore a matter of research design and research strategy. 

During the course we will examine such research designs and strategies and look at the relevance of different assumptions behind these methods. The course also addresses the benefits of experimental data and introduces several new statistical and econometrical methods designed to improve causal statements from non-experimental and observational data.

Learn how to apply some of the tools from the Literacy Design Collaborative to incorporate Common Core literacy standards into your content area. In this course you will explore Literacy Design Collaborative Resources, create a teaching task, and develop a plan to use the task within classroom instruction.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
The Common Core State Standards are new and will challenge our students to show evidence of learning in new ways.  Instructional shifts are required, especially for teachers who must now incorporate literacy into content areas. Integrating the literacy standards can be difficult to do well. In this course you will have the support of a community and harness the power of collaboratively exchanging ideas with colleagues, as you design a teaching task (writing prompt) aligned with the Common Core.
 
You will use a template from the Literacy Design Collaborative (LDC) to design a task that incorporates literacy into your content area and then create a brief plan for its use. These template tasks are a part of a much more in-depth LDC Module design and will serve to introduce you to the model and process.   

Course Syllabus
In the first section of this course, you will review the Common Core shifts and be introduced to the Literacy Design Collaborative model. Then you will examine the template tasks. Next you will learn what makes a quality task and design one of your own. You&#39;ll also have opportunities to explore Literacy Design Collaborative resources to support your learning of the model. Finally you will either revise the task you previously wrote or design a new one, based on feedback from your peers, and then create a brief plan of how you could use your task.

 

Throughout this course you will explore resources and watch video excerpts that describe the Literacy Design Collaborative model and teachers&#39; experiences with its implementation.

This course offers participants an opportunity to engage in a community of learners using an inquiry cycle focusing on math formative assessments as a strategy for implementing CCSS in math. It focuses on the implementation of a Classroom Challenge: a 1 – 2 day lesson developed by the Mathematics Assessment Project (MAP) based on formative assessment and the CCSSM.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
The Common Core State Standards in Mathematics (CCSSM) offer the opportunity for educators to transform teaching and learning by positioning students in more active roles as learners. In addition to explicit content standards (which describe what students will know), the CCSSM present a broad range of practice standards that describe ways that successful students in math demonstrate proficiency. What do students and teachers need to know to take on these standards? What does it mean, for example, for students to persevere through new and challenging problems, and/or critique the reasoning of other students, and how can their teachers best support them?

In the words of one math teacher, “it’s not the students’ job to figure out what is in our heads; it’s the teacher’s job to figure out what is in theirs.” Such an approach requires far more focus on formative assessment and deliberate strategies for teachers to pre-assess students’ assets, needs, and misconceptions – then move them forward while continually re-assessing. 
Course Syllabus
In this course, you will gain access to the MAP’s website, and choose from among 60 Classroom Challenges to teach, in order to effectively use formative assessment to move student thinking forward while enhancing your own teaching practice. In the first section, you will consider content you will soon be teaching, then select and explore a Classroom Challenge that aligns with that content. You will give an initial assessment in order to measure and better-understand students’ current understanding of the content, as well as uncover gaps and misconceptions. In the second section, you will analyze the results of the initial assessment, note assets, gaps, and misconceptions, and then use the provided resources in the Classroom Challenge to teach your students through collaborative and whole-group activities – culminating with a re-assessment of students’ understanding.  In the final section, you will compare the initial and post assessment data, and discuss how using the Classroom Challenge in your class enhanced student understanding as well as your own teaching practice.

How can we use the things we share in common to address some of the most challenging problems facing the world? This course examines issues concerning poverty, the environment, technology, health care, gender, education and activism to helps us understand better how to initiate positive change.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
How to Change the World has its origins in the Social Good Summit held at the 92nd Street Y in New York. The summit brought together some of the world&#39;s most creative entrepreneurs, writers, academics and political leaders to discuss ways innovative thinking and technology can address pressing global challenges.  Beginning from talks, panels and conversations from the summit, we will add lectures, on-line discussion groups, hangouts and readings to explore the issues in politics, technology and the environment in broader academic and historical contexts. We will then discover together what actions we can take to make a difference.    

 




Course Syllabus
How to Change the World examines how we can develop “social goods” and use them to create networks of progressive change. Classes will explore the meaning of “social goods” and then address the following topics: Poverty and Philanthropy; Climate Change and Sustainability; Women, Education and Social Change; Social Networks, Education and Activism. Each week will be structured along the following questions: 1. What do we know?  2. Why should we care? 3. What can we do?

At the end of the class students should have a clearer understanding of these global issues, and they should develop strategies for working with others to begin to address them. Our aim is simple and bold: to put together the facts, the energy and the actions to make a real difference in addressing some of the major problems confronting the world today.

Course Syllabus

Week 1: What are Social Goods? What is the Commons?

Week 2: Poverty and Development

Week 3: Climate Change and Sustainability

Week 4: Disease and Global Health Care

Week 5: Women, Education and Social Change

Week 6: Looking Back, Looking Forward


Recommended Background
No recommended background is required; all are welcome.
Suggested Readings
There will be weekly readings provided as PDFs or as links. Materials will range from philosophy to fiction, from economics to art.

Course Format
Each week there will be lectures, many of which will be put together from presentations at the Social Good Summit. Michael Roth will introduce the topics and raise questions that we will consider together as we come to terms with these contemporary challenges. Other resources from Wesleyan, the 92nd St Y, Mashable and the United Nations will be deployed to enrich the course content.

Students will be encouraged to participate in the discussion forums, and to meet together when possible to discuss the issues raised in the class. Students will write short essays on each week’s topic, and these will be assessed by other students in the class. Students will consider “action plans,” concrete steps they can take to do something positive in relation to the global challenges discussed in the class.

FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.

What is the Social Good Summit?
The Social Good Summit is a three-day conference that unites a dynamic community of global leaders to discuss a big idea: the power of innovative thinking and technology to solve our greatest challenges.  The summit is presented by 92 Street Y, Mashable, the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and Ericsson.</field>

	<field name="course_intro">Children Acquiring Literacy Naturally
This course will survey fundamental principles of language acquisition and learning to read. We will explore the possibility of becoming literate without formal schooling and instruction. No prior background in behavioral science, neuroscience, or technology is required.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Have recent developments in behavioral science, neuroscience, and technology made it possible to achieve universal literacy with minimal cost? This course explores that important question. The lectures contemplate a revolutionary new age that challenges the survival of our educational institutions and society as we know them. Learn about current research and theory in language acquisition, reading pedagogy, and wearable computing to assess the possibility of an interactive system that would enable infants, toddlers, and preschool children to acquire literacy naturally.

Course Syllabus
Lecture 1:  The course begins with the guiding proposal that universal literacy can be achieved with minimal cost. It questions the commonly held belief that written language requires formal instruction and schooling whereas spoken language is seamlessly acquired from birth onward by natural interactions with persons who talk. This proposal is followed by an overview of the scientific process because the research and theory discussed in the class will consist of alternative perspectives and the students will learn how different perspectives are developed and evaluated. This process will enhance their critical thinking skills.
Lecture 2: There have been two primary theoretical frameworks to describe language and its acquisition. The nativist position holds that language and its acquisition are uniquely dependent on a considerable amount of innate abilities, and unlike other perceptual and cognitive functions. The empiricist position holds that very little, if any, of language depends on innate abilities and its acquisition can be accounted for by typical perceptual and cognitive processes. To evaluate these two theoretical frameworks, we will learn about language structure, how it is used, and how it is acquired.

Lectures 3 and 4: To set the stage for assessing the possibility of naturally acquired reading, we will explore speech perception and how it is acquired. Speech has also had two alternative theoretical frameworks, and we will consider relevant research that addresses their differences. The goal of this assessment is to better understand what is required for speech perception and its acquisition and how these requirements compare to the natural acquisition of reading.

Lectures 5 and 6: These lectures will give an overview of research and theory on reading and literacy. Given the possibility of naturally acquired reading, we will review the nature of reading and how it is currently taught. One of the main goals is to destroy prevalent myths about how we read. This discussion will highlight the assumptions in current practice and how they compare to the possibility of naturally acquired reading.

Lecture 7: As covered in the previous lectures, it is commonly believed that spoken and signed languages are acquired from birth onward by natural interactions with persons who talk whereas learning to read requires formal instruction and schooling. We consider the hypothesis that once an appropriate form of written text is made available early in a child’s life before formal schooling begins, reading will also be learned inductively, emerge naturally, and with no significant negative consequences. We will examine the role of perception and action modalities in language acquisition and use and compare spoken and signed languages to written languages.

Lecture 8: We will describe the demographics of literacy and illiteracy and their social and economic implications. The cost of illiteracy as well as the huge cost of formal literacy instruction is one of the major financial burdens on societies.

Lecture 9: We will study the implications of naturally acquired literacy for individuals who are spoken and/or written language challenged because of deafness or other impairments.

Lecture 10. We will review past technological developments to set the stage for peering into the future. We will discuss the various technologies available or soon to be available that will allow growing children to experience an augmented reality that will be capable of supplementing their real world experience with various forms of language generated automatically.

Recommended Background
You should be familiar with or interested in understanding the scientific method, the structural features of language and how it is understood, and how evidence-based inquiry guides behavioral science inquiry.

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Eating patterns that begin in childhood affect health and wellbeing across the lifespan. In the USA, we are in the midst of a childhood obesity epidemic that threatens to leave our children with a shorter life expectancy than their parents. As processed foods become more readily available around the world, other developed nations are beginning to follow suit. This course examines contemporary child nutrition in America from the individual decisions made by each family to the widespread food marketing targeting our children.  The health risks associated with obesity in childhood are also discussed. Students will learn what constitutes a healthy diet for children and adults and how to prepare simple, delicious foods aimed at inspiring a lifelong celebration of easy home-cooked meals. This course will help prepare students to be the leading health providers, teachers and parents of the present and future.
Course Syllabus
Week one: Introduction to the problem - the childhood obesity epidemic facing the USA in particular and many developed nations who are following suit. Why should we care and what can be done? What are the current recommendations, how have they changed and how well are we doing in meeting our children&#39;s dietary needs? Cooking also starts this week with how to make a simple breakfast and a stir-fry. We also explore the six basic ingredients every cook should have on hand! 

Week two: What constitutes a balanced meal? What are carbohydrates, fats and proteins and how do we choose the healthiest of these? What is a glycemic index? Learn tricks for controlling portion sizes while maintaining satisfaction; cooking continues with more healthy breakfast alternatives, an easy dinner all in one dish, and a simple, (gluten-free) cake for special occasions. 

Week three: How to pack a quick, healthy lunch for a child and why this is so important; how to shop for fruits and vegetables and navigate the supermarket for better health; what are the benefits of the family meal? How can we &quot;make over&quot; our children&#39;s favorite foods, and help them enjoy healthier treats? 

Week four: How do plant a kitchen garden? Gardening as a way of getting children excited about fresh foods; learn what&#39;s meant by the terms &quot;organic&quot; and &quot;locally grown&quot;; learn more creative ideas for serving vegetables, how to involve children in the kitchen and basic techniques for making soups and cooking fish. 

Week five: Summing it all up. What have we learned about encouraging the right food choices despite environmental challenges like advertising and readily available processed foods? How can we make choices that benefit our health and the health of our planet? Cooking this week: the simple stew, a basic homemade salad dressing plus a Sunday morning treat that will make the whole family smile.

	<field name="course_intro">Preventing Chronic Pain: A Human Systems Approach
Chronic pain is at epidemic levels and has become the highest-cost condition in health care. This course uses both creative and experiential learning to better understand chronic pain conditions and how they can be prevented through self-management in our cognitive, behavioral, physical, emotional, spiritual, social, and environmental realms.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Chronic musculoskeletal pain (including head, neck, and back pain) is a significant cause of suffering, disability, and health care in the world. Care for chronic pain often involves surgery, multiple medications (including opioids), endless physical and chiropractic therapy, injections, implanted devices, and other passive treatments-- making it the highest cost condition in health care. The burden upon individuals in terms of ongoing pain and suffering is incalculable.

Consider an alternative. By using a human systems approach, we can better understand how individual risk factors in the cognitive, behavioral, physical, emotional, spiritual, social, and environmental realms of our lives can interact to perpetuate chronic pain and, if improved, can prevent it.  

During this course, you will: Identify the problems of our health care system in dealing with chronic pain. Review the diagnosis, mechanisms, and etiology of musculoskeletal pain conditions. Explore specific risk factors that can contribute to chronic pain. Learn how a human systems approach can be applied through evidence-based self-management strategies to prevent chronic pain. Experience active strategies designed to enhance the protective factors that can transform our own lives, and those of our patients, to one of health and wellness.

Suggested Readings
Although many of the class materials will be provided online, students who want to expand their knowledge beyond the materials provided can find further coverage of the course topics in various recommended readings, which we will include (among others):  

Recommended:
Innovate or Die!, Dr. Jack V. Matson (1996)
CENTER, Dr. Darrell Velegol
Creative Diversity, Dr. Kathryn Jablokow (2013) - in press with sections released in the course
Course Format
This course will employ both traditional and nontraditional methods of online teaching, with a focus on experiential learning. Each module will consist of videos to showcase new concepts and introduce case studies with optional creative exercises that encourage the learner to go down unexpected paths to critical moments of understanding. Interactive discussions with course professors on discussion forums and video chats and reflective writing pieces will stimulate students to look within themselves to perceive changes occurring in their lives.

By definition, this course also needs to live up to its name by being creative, innovative, and inviting change while it is in progress. In the spirit of co-creation, we will be open to new perspectives about these topics and will incorporate them as the course evolves. From week to week, we will discuss insights into the learning process from participant submissions and feedback, and we will integrate these insights into the course.
FAQ
Why is it important for me to to take this course?
Creativity and the process of innovation are essential to the growth and well being of individuals, organizations, and nations. In this course, you will have the opportunity to learn how you can be a strong positive force in your society and how to pass on your knowledge and experience to others so that everyone will prosper. 

Are there different tracks I can take based upon my level of commitment?
From previous MOOC offerings, we know that not all students engage with the course materials and assignments in the same way or with the same intensity. This is fully understandable! You might have lots of time and interest, and so are ready to invest deeply in this course; or you might have many life commitments that leave you with less time, but still want to learn many of the concepts that this course will offer. We want to make our class useful for YOU -- whatever your life and interests lead you to right now -- and so we are creating three kinds of student profiles, called Adventurers, Explorers, and Tourists.

Adventurers. You have signed up for the class and are serious about mastering the entire course. You are committed to doing the course-related quizzes, activities, and assignments, AND you are eager and able to complete a course-long project, either alone or as part of a team. As an Adventurer, you want to take full advantage of this great opportunity to build on your creative potential and create something innovative that will change your life or the lives of those around you for the better!

Explorers. You are eager to learn and contribute to the course, but your available time allows you to participate only in the class assignments (weekly quizzes and activities), not in project work. You are excited about the material and play an active role in the course, perhaps by providing feedback and mentoring other students, just as Adventurers and Tourists can do at any time. We need the contributions of everyone in the community!

Tourists. You have signed up for the class, love it, want to take it, but because of other commitments in life, you cannot commit to the course all the time. This is fine! As a Tourist, you come and go to the course platform, watch some of the videos now and then, participate in some activities here and there, and do your best to stick with the class from the beginning to the end , trying to get as much as you can out of it. Maybe ...you will have more time to commit to the class in future offerings! 

Has this course been taught before?
Yes, in a classroom setting. In converting this material into a MOOC format, we are conducting a grand experiment - and one in which we invite you to participate fully  

Will there be exams? What will I have to turn in? 
Some of the modules will contain quizzes to assess skill development and mastery. Other modules will require other kinds of output (e.g., idea journals, prototypes) to demonstrate progress.  

How will the course be graded?
Course participants will submit ideas, products, and exercises for peer review. The peer review process is an essential component of the class, as it exposes students to creative diversity from the feedback they receive and inspiration from other projects they review. All participants who complete the specified number of assignments with quality deemed appropriate will receive a statement of accomplishment documenting successful course completion. 

Will the course be challenging? Will it be fun? 
Yes. Contrary to popular belief, creativity is something that we can study pretty rigorously, and that’s a good thing. Besides, as other people have probably been telling you all your life - you get out of learning what you put into it. But there will also be ample opportunities to have fun in this course, so you can expect to enjoy it as well!  

Will I be expected to produce something creative? What if I fail? 
Yes - and we will guide you there. The creative “something” you produce will align with your own unique brand of creativity, whether you are a person who thinks creatively through careful attention to detail or a person who prefers to break through barriers for innovative results. Either way, failure is part of the process; your success will be a function of what you learn from each failure.</field>

This course introduces students to strategies for style writing of common practice European art music. The issues of harmonic progression, voice leading, and texture are addressed in addition to relevant compositional concepts like repetition, variation, and elaboration. The course aims to offer a creative space even within the restrictions of stylistic emulation.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This course aims to give students a set of approaches for composition in the style of Classical and Romantic era European art music.  The principles and skills in this course engage one as much as possible in the thinking of composers from those eras, giving the student compositional freedoms that composers of that era enjoyed.  The issues of harmonic progression, voice leading, and texture are addressed in addition to relevant compositional concepts such as common tones, leading tones, repetition, variation, and elaboration.

The course offers presentations, demonstrations, and exercises for self-
evaluation.  Assessment involves a variety of short compositions in common textures found during the 18th and 19th centuries.

This course assumes that the student has had exposure to the basic principles of tonal harmony, musicianship, and/or some similar music theory introductory course.  Students should be fairly comfortable with roman numeral analysis or, at least, chord symbols and common harmonic progressions.  This course is not aimed exclusively at musicians with a classical music background.  Rock, pop, and jazz musicians might find this course interesting as a stylistic contrast to the genres they usually work in.

What is Climate Change? How should we respond to Climate Change? These questions are complex, not least because the responses available to us depend upon who is providing the answers and the particular perspective they take. The economist sees the economic challenges and opportunities of Climate Change; the scientist sees the need to describe and explain Climate Change; the policy-maker and social scientist see Climate Change as a social problem. Therefore, the first step to understanding Climate Change and what we do about it is to see how experts from different disciplines engage with the issue. The second step is to appreciate how our response to Climate Change depends upon the interplay between these different approaches.

This course offers you an introduction to different disciplinary perspectives on Climate Change to help you think about how Climate Change affects you as an individual, as a member of your local community, as a citizen of your country and as a member of the global community. We have designed the presentations, discussions, activities and assessment tasks in this course to help you understand what Climate Change is and what you – and we – should do about it.

Course Syllabus
The overall aim of this subject is to provide an introduction to the socio-political, scientific, and economic aspects of the phenomenon known as Climate Change. In doing so it is hoped that the student will emerge with an enhanced ability to analyse claims both about the science itself and the responses that can be made by humanity at present and for the future, based on current scientific data and its predictions over the next decades. 

You will emerge with a broad understanding of the science underpinning the claim that human activity has played a role in causing the current rise in global temperature. You will also develop an awareness of the present and future impact on global communities, the political response to such impacts, and consider basic economic concepts and models that describe a framework in which changes to our use of resources can occur. 

Recommended Background
No background is necessary. This subject is designed to be accessible to students from any discipline.
Suggested Readings
A collection of readings pertinent to each topic will be made available online.
Course Format
This course will run for 9 weeks comprising of short video lectures, quiz questions, discussion groups and additional short assignments. 
FAQ
What resources will I need for this class?
There are three kinds of resources you will find useful in this subject. 

Firstly, there are the collection of readings that have been chosen by each of the instructors in this subject to help support your discussions and assignment work. These will be made available to you electronically.

Secondly, there are the resources available to you in the many and varied texts on climate change in the public domain (social media, news sources, periodicals, literature, film, works of art, etc.). Although these should be examined critically before being incorporated into the arguments you make, they do give you access to information about current and rapidly changing events.

Finally, there are your own experiences and interests. Draw upon these in your discussions, debates and assignments. 

What is the coolest thing I&#39;ll learn if I take this class?
You will learn that the issue of Climate Change is incredibly complex, however it can also be very accessible if you can see it from different perspectives and approach it with an open mind and a willingness to engage in discussion and action along with others.

• Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?

A Statement of Accomplishment will be offered to those students who successfully pass the assessments as laid out in the syllabus. A verified Statement of Accomplishment will be offered to those students who enroll in the course using Signature Track and who successfully pass the assessments.</field>

Climate Literacy tackles the scientific and socio-political dimensions of climate change. This course introduces the basics of the climate system, models and predictions, human and natural impacts, mitigative and adaptive responses, and the evolution of climate policy.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This course explores the basic concepts and terms needed to understand the science of climate change, and the available mitigation, adaptation and policy options. By the end of the course, students will be able to:

·  Tell the story of our climate, describing how interactions among atmosphere, ocean, land, and life lead to climatic changes at all timescales

·  Evaluate the likely effect of historical human fossil emissions and land use changes on Earth’s energy balance and climate.

·  Describe the direct observations of climate change in recent decades, and articulate the evidence attributing global warming in this time period to human causes.

·  Assess the utility - and limits - of climate models to predict global and regional climate change.

·  Articulate the demographic, economic, technological and political factors that influence both humans’ impact on the climate and humans’ vulnerability to climate change.

·  Express an informed opinion on the scope and urgency of the efforts needed to both mitigate and adapt to climate change.

 We provide the scientific basics of climate change paired with the response options (mitigation and adaptation) and policy landscape. Focusing exclusively on the science of climate change may not allow a nuanced understanding of the social implications of this science.  Similarly, political or economic analyses of climate change frequently neglect the underlying mechanics behind climate change thresholds, feedbacks, and the potential for abrupt change. This course explores linkages between climate change and other pressing priorities such as human health, poverty, community livability, economic resilience, and other environmental problems (such as biodiversity and water quality).  We acknowledge the urgent need to design innovative strategies that realize multiple objectives (or co-benefits) simultaneously, and explore the particular capacity for sustainability and climate change to provide an avenue for achieving these objectives. 

Course Syllabus
Climate Literacy is delivered in ten Modules.  The first half of the course deals mainly with climate change science and models, while the second half of the course speaks to climate change impacts, response options, and polices.  The Modules are as follows: 

1.  Climate in the public sphere

Climate change is a pervasive and challenging phenomenon that can be viewed through a multitude of lenses. A scientific lens, for instance, reveals altered ecosystems and climatic tipping points while the lens of ethics raises the question of the right to develop and influence the well-being of others while doing so. This module will introduce you to a few of the core concepts that you will need to delve deeper into the science and policy of climate change. We will explore the broad findings offered by the scientific community with regard to our influence on the climate system, the policy tools that we have developed to respond to this challenge, and the core of the climate change debate in scientific, political, and lay communities.

2.  Introduction to the climate system

In this first module of the science section of the course, we’ll look at the big picture of Earth’s climate system.  What are the parts?  What are some of the major interactions among the parts?  We’ll spend some time learning about the energy-related units we’ll use in this course, some basics of systems dynamics, which is one of the overarching frameworks in this course, and then we’ll have a look at data showing how Earth’s climate has changed over time. 

3.  Earth&#39;s energy budget

This module covers the basics of climatology at the planetary scale. We will trace the path of energy coming in from the Sun and leaving the planet as thermal radiation (or infrared), and explore the various factors affecting these flows: greenhouse gases, aerosols, surface albedo, and clouds. We will investigate how humans influence these climate controls, and compare anthropogenic factors to natural factors such as variation in solar energy and volcanic eruptions.

4. The carbon cycle

Our planet breathes; its biosphere on land and in the oceans inhales and exhales oxygen and carbon dioxide every second. Even water and rocks exchange carbon dioxide with the atmosphere. Humans, particularly through deforestation and fossil fuel use, have a significant impact on the planetary carbon cycle. This module explores the natural carbon cycle, the perturbations in carbon stocks and flows from human activities, and the climate system&#39;s response to human perturbations. 

5.  Climate models

Climate models are crucial tools to help people understand the complexities and dynamic interactions within Earth&#39;s climate system.  Models are built on our understanding of basic physics and Earth processes, and are grounded in observations and measurements of the world around us.  In this module, we&#39;ll explore different types of climate models, consider some of the choices you&#39;d need to make as a climate modeler, and have a look at some climate model output compared to observations.  Since we only have one planet, and can only run one global climate experiment in the real world, models are our only tools to help us peer into the future and ask &quot;what if...&quot; questions.  The range of probable outcomes from possible future scenarios helps us make decisions about mitigation and adaptation.  

6.  Future climate

Now that we have a clearer sense of the principles, components and assumptions of climate models, we’ll look more closely at their results. Given hypothetical future pathways, including possibilities for our own future actions, like carbon emissions, what range of temperature increases can we expect? How will future changes affect the climatic factors that are most relevant to humans and ecosystems: precipitation, circulation patterns, extreme events, melting of snow and ice, etc? These global projections give us estimates of what we can expect if we embark on various emission and development paths, and offer a broad view for decision-making. The least well-known aspect of these projections is what choices we, the human community, will make in the future. 

7.  Climate change impacts

As we have seen, the emission of vast quantities of greenhouse gases by humans fundamentally influences the global climatic system. The chain reaction does not end here, however. Rising temperatures and sea levels, changing precipitation patterns, and ocean acidification, for instance, trigger dramatic shifts in the way that human and natural systems function.

This module forms the transition between the science of climate change, which we have explored in Modules 2-6, and the more human-oriented Modules 7-10.

8.  Climate change mitigation: dealing with the causes

Now that we understand the central causes of anthropogenic climate change, and the impacts that we can expect to (and already) experience, the next step is to explore the response options that are available to us. The most commonly-discussed response to climate change is mitigation: tackling the causes of climate change by reducing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The aim of mitigation is to reduce the severity and frequency of climate change impacts, thereby protecting ecosystems and human societies.

This module will explore the basic concept of mitigation, the core mitigation strategies that we currently have available to us, the innovative action that is being taken around the world, and leading-edge ideas with regard to tackling the roots of climate change. By the end of this module, you will be able to critique the likelihood of implementation of many of these strategies, and will have a framework through which you can learn more about greenhouse gas management, both at home and around the world.

9.  Climate change adaptation: dealing with the effects

In contrast to the previous module, this module introduces the idea of addressing the impacts of climate change rather than its causes. In particular, we will explore the various adaptation strategies that are available to be utilized around the world, the heated debate surrounding the equity implications of adaptation, and the linkages between adaptation and mitigation. By the end of this module we will have explored the difference between proactive and reactive adaptation, and our track record with both. We will outline the most common and effective adaptation strategies, including those related to human settlements, ecosystems, and the broader issue of development. Finally, we will explore the inevitable trade-offs between adaptation and mitigation, setting us up to finish this course with a survey of climate change response policies.

10.  Policy tools for mitigation and adaptation

This Module forms a bridge between this first course in the Decision-making for Climate Change series, and the three courses that will follow. Given what we know now about the science behind climate change, and the strategies that we have at our disposal for responding to it, we can now be introduced to policies that bear this in mind. After being introduced to the fundamentals of mitigation and adaptation policy, we will use the British Columbia carbon tax and the proposed cap-and-trade system in the United States as relevant examples. Finally, we will finish with a glimpse forward to the future of climate change policy, and the most promising opportunities for both managing impacts and ensuring a rapid transition to a fundamentally low-carbon development path.

Neurologic diseases are common and costly. According to estimates by the World Health Organization, neurologic disorders affect over 1 billion people worldwide, constitute 12% of the global burden of disease, and cause 14% of global deaths.  Furthermore, the number of deaths caused by neurological diseases have more than doubled in the past 10 years, and this number will undoubtedly substantially increase in the coming years as the average age of the world’s population increase.

This course will provide a basic overview of the most common and important neurological diseases and conditions affecting people worldwide: stroke, epilepsy, headache, back pain, neurodegenerative diseases, movement disorders, alterations of consciousness, nervous system infections, traumatic brain injury, and neuromuscular diseases.  For each topic, a neurology professor at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) who has specialized knowledge about the subject area, and who teaches this material to UCSF medical students and other health professional students, will focus on the fundamentals of the clinical presentation and evaluation of people with these disorders, as well as some of the additional diagnostic approaches and options for treatment.  Although not a primary focus of the course, the faculty will also touch on some of the most pertinent disease mechanisms to help students appreciate the rationale for current therapies and the many questions that need to be answered to achieve effective treatments and cures.

Course Syllabus
This six-week course includes the following eleven modules:

Module 1: Overview of basic anatomy and functions of the nervous system.
Module 2: Stroke
Module 3: Epilepsy
Module 4: Neurodegenerative diseases
Module 5: Alterations of consciousness and brain death
Module 6: Nervous system infections
Module 7: Traumatic brain injury
Module 8: Movement disorders
Module 9: Headache
Module 10: Back pain
Module 11: Neuromuscular diseases

Recommended Background
Students who take this course should ideally have at least a basic knowledge of neuroanatomy and neurophysiology.  For example, students should be familiar with the basic structure and function of the central and peripheral nervous system, including the lobes of the brain, the various parts of the brainstem and spinal cord, the main ascending and descending central pathways, and basic properties of peripheral nerves and muscle. Having at least a basic understanding of the way various cells in the nervous system work (such as properties of action potentials and other aspects of neural transmission) will be helpful but not essential for this course.  To make sure everyone is up to speed at the beginning, the class will start with an overview of the anatomy and functions of the nervous system as they relate to the various clinical diseases covered during the course.

The course will cover the basic guiding principles of the Clinical Psychology of Children and Young People and illustrate how theories of psychological development can be applied in understanding children and young people&#39;s mental health and well being within a wider societal and cultural context. We will also discuss current psychological models of prevention and treatment for Children and Young People.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This course will offer a broad introduction to the core models of psychological development and current debates in Applied Developmental Psychology and the practice of the Clinical Psychology of Children and Young People.

By the end of the course you will be able to:
Understand essential developmental processes and how they relate to child and adolescent mental health and well being
Understand key mental health difficulties that affect children and young people
Develop a critical reflection on the nature and perception of typical and atypical development and psychological difficulties 
Understand and to critically examine the cultural and societal context for child and adolescent development and developmental psychopathology.
Throughout the course we will invite you to reflect on how childhood is defined and perceived from a developmental and clinical psychology perspective.  We want to examine the risks of pathologising the range of human experiences and in underestimating the active role that children play in shaping their development.  A key perspective that we will adopt throughout the course is that of individual adaptation and an understanding of the psychological processes that allow individuals to respond to past events and circumstances as well as others around them in their physical, emotional and psychological development.   

We will further look at current models of prevention and psychological intervention for Children and Young people who present with mental health difficulties and how these are implemented and evaluated within public and mental heath settings. 
Course Syllabus
Introduction

Matthias Schwannauer



Week 1: What is Development 

Jo Williams

Overview of current theories of child development, reflecting on how these theories apply in practice.

What is normal and abnormal development? Which are the key factors involved in determining and influencing individual development?  

 

Week 2: Attachment 

Emily Taylor

In this week we will discuss Attachment Theory and current models of attachment.  We will investigate how early experiences shape our development and mental well being, and in which way emotional attachment and mental health interact throughout childhood and adolescence. 



Week 3: Risk and Resilience  

Emily Taylor

In this week we will examine how factors of risk, reliance and vulnerability interact throughout the child and young person&#39;s development. We examine the effect of trauma and maltreatment on the mental health and well being of children and which factors protect against the negative impact of such significant negative life events.  Past and current conceptualisations will be considered within applied settings to question how these conceptualisations help assessment and intervention for children and young people.

 

Week 4: The Psychology of Adolescence 

Stella Chan

In week four we will examine the psychology of adolescence and why adolescent development is a key period for individual transition, but also a period in which major mental health difficulties emerge.  We will also take a look at how adolescents are perceived and the role society plays in their development. We will examine what makes adolescents vulnerable to emotional health problems and approaches of psychological interventions.     

 

Week 5: Applied Developmental Psychopathology 

Matthias Schwannauer

In this final week we will look at models of psychological development and approaches to developmental psychopathology. How can we better understand mental health difficulties in children and young people and what can we learn from their adaptability and resilience in the face of stressors and difficult contexts.  We will also have a closer look at psychological models of prevention and intervention of mental health difficulties and their implementation in health care systems and mental health services in particular. We will use the mental health and well being of our children and young people as a mirror to look at the psychological resilience of our societies. 



Recommended Background

	<field name="course_intro">Clinical Terminology for International and U.S. Students
Understanding the clinical terms and abbreviations commonly used in U.S. hospitals is challenging. Adaptation to clinical language is difficult for U.S. students entering the clinical area and even more difficult for international students whose primary language is not English. This course helps both groups of students understand many of the terms and abbreviations commonly encountered during the first three months of clinical work on a U.S. general hospital unit.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
The language of health care providers at U.S. clinical sites is heavily infused with abbreviations and technical terms. Frequently, there is little time to ask for explanations. This course focuses on terms and abbreviations that will be heard or seen during early clinical work. Terms are presented according to the clinical context in which they will be experienced using print, audio and visual representations. A web-based clinical dictionary for beginners provides additional information about terms presented in the course as well as definitions of many important terms that could not be covered in the six week course.

Course Syllabus
Week 1: Understanding the structure of clinical terms and abbreviations 
Clinical Focus: Vital Signs 

Week 2: Solving clinical word puzzles 
Clinical Focus: The Clinical Unit and Bedside Environment 

Week 3: Refining strategies for solving clinical word puzzles 
Clinical Focus: Emergencies, Medication and IV fluid Administration 

Week 4: Dealing with acronyms 
Clinical Focus: Diseases and Related Abbreviations 

Week 5: Using clinical language safely 
Clinical Focus: Laboratory Tests and Diagnostic Procedures 

Week 6: Assessing your ability to use what you have learned 
Clinical Conversations: Practice hearing, seeing, and responding to true-to-life clinical situations
Recommended Background
This course is for International and U.S. students and health professionals who are beginning or will be experiencing clinical practice in the United States. Knowledge of anatomy and physiology and common disease states supports success.

Suggested Readings
All references and materials will be offered within the course or found on the Internet.

Course Format
This course consists of 6 modules introduced by a video presentation. Using a language-learning approach, definitions of terms and abbreviations are supplemented with audio, images, and video-recordings. Strategies for effective learning and opportunities to use new terms and abbreviations are offered. Quiz questions accompany each module. A web-based clinical terminology dictionary at http://www.ClinicalTerminology.org provides additional information about the course content and definitions of many additional terms and abbreviations not included in the course. The web-based dictionary remains available to students after the course is completed.

FAQ
Question: Why do I need to learn these terms, abbreviations and acronyms?

Response: Medical terms, abbreviations and acronyms are a large part of the verbal and written communication that occurs in clinical situations in the U.S. Abbreviations are used to increase efficiency by shortening the time to communicate. If you want to join in any conversation about clinical matters, you need to understand terms, abbreviations and acronyms.
Question: Why can’t I just ask for clarification when someone uses a term or abbreviation?

Response: Of course you can always ask for clarification. However, clinical settings in U.S. hospitals are often very busy, noisy places with people hurrying about to meet patients’ needs. There will be little time for explanation of the meanings of words. The more emergent the situation, the more likely that abbreviations will be used. When you know a term or abbreviation before you hear it on the clinical unit, you are a better communicator and a more effective healthcare team member.
Question: Will I learn all the medical or nursing abbreviations and acronyms?

Response: No. This is a course for beginning students. A major advantage is that the course helps you to focuses on those terms that you are most likely to hear or see during your early clinical training.
Question: How will this course help me in my healthcare studies and clinical practice?

Response: This course emphasizes learning to recognize and interpret common spoken and written clinical terms and abbreviations necessary for clear communication with patients and health care providers. Understanding and learning clinical language will help you to function more effectively and safely as a healthcare team member.
Question: Will I be able to interact with other students taking this course?

Response: Yes. The Clinical Terminology General Discussion Board is available for communication and meet-ups are encouraged.
What if I have a question about the course?

Response: Since the course engages thousands of students, the instructors cannot communicate directly with each student. You are encouraged to post questions, comments, problems, and ideas on the Clinical Terminology General Discussion Board. If you have technical questions, you can send a request for assistance to accessibility@coursera.org.

This course is designed to meet the educational needs of a national audience of physicians and allied health professionals who specialize in family practice, primary care, internal medicine and oncology.

Course Description
Racial and ethnic diversity is critical to the success of cancer clinical trials. Asian Americans, like other ethnic groups, have low recruitment, accrual and retention rates in cancer clinical trials. This represents a significant challenge on a national level for health advocates, healthcare institutions and the National Cancer Institute. To improve communication and awareness of clinical trials for Asian American patients, it is important to increase learners’ knowledge about cancer clinical trials and cultural humility. This online course will educate healthcare providers and allied health professionals about cancer clinical trials and cultural humility skills as well as provide educational resources and tips for reinforcing change in practice to improve outcomes in Asian American clinical trial participation.

Learning Objectives
Develop strategies to determine appropriate patients for clinical trials.
Apply cultural humility skills to effectively communicate with Asian American patients about cancer clinical trials.
Identify at least 5 ways that will reinforce change in practice to incorporate clinical trials education and referral among Asian American patients and apply it in practice.
Recognize how to access at least 5 cancer clinical trial resources and use them in education and referral.

Participants will learn how to move efficiently from patient signs and symptoms to a rational and prioritized set of diagnostic possibilities and will learn how to study and read to facilitate this process.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Clinical problem solving or diagnostic reasoning is the skill that physicians use to understand a patient’s complaints and then to identify a short, prioritized list of possible diagnoses that could account for those complaints.  This differential diagnosis then drives the choice of diagnostic tests and possible treatments. Despite striking advances in information technology, clinical problem solving has not yet been effectively replicated by computers, making it essential that clinicians work to develop expertise in this very important skill set.  While television shows make this seem like a magical process, work done by cognitive psychologists and medical educators has helped us understand the ways in which expert physicians reason through these difficult problems to help their patients.
 
This course will examine the ways physicians think about clinical problem solving and will help participants develop competence in the building blocks of clinical problem solving. The professor will use cases to illustrate different reasoning strategies and will discuss how both correct and incorrect diagnoses result from these strategies. Participants will use sample clinical cases to practice what they have learned through the lectures. Finally, the professor will discuss strategies to help students and young physicians read textbooks and articles in a way that enhances their ability to use information in the clinical environment. 
Course Syllabus
Module 1: How experts understand diseases and how to read like an expert to form disease based illness scripts.
Module 2: How experts analyze their patient&#39; problems: processing and the patient illness script.
Module 3: Using disease and patient illness scripts to prioritize differential diagnostic possibilities into tiers of probability
Module 4: Understanding how diagnostic tests can be appropriately used to improve diagnostic accuracy.
Module 5: Diagnostic Mistakes: how they happen, how you can avoid them and how to find them once they occur.
Module 6: How our clinical problem solving strategies can be used to write good test questions, perform well on tests, and teach others to do well too.

Learn the basic principles for design of randomized clinical trials and how they should be reported.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Clinical trials are experiments designed to evaluate new interventions to prevent or treat disease in humans.  The interventions evaluated can be drugs, devices (e.g., hearing aid), surgeries, behavioral interventions (e.g., smoking cessation program), community health programs (e.g. cancer screening programs) or health delivery systems (e.g., special care units for hospital admissions).  We consider clinical trials experiments because the investigators rather the patients or their doctors select the treatment the patients receive.  Results from randomized clinical trials are usually considered the highest level of evidence for determining whether a treatment is effective because trials incorporates features to ensure that evaluation of the benefits and risks of treatments are objective and unbiased.  The FDA requires that drugs or biologics (e.g., vaccines) are shown to be effective in clinical trials before they can be sold in the US.

The course will explain the basic principles for design of randomized clinical trials and how they should be reported.  In the first part of the course, students will be introduced to terminology used in clinical trials and the several common designs used for clinical trials, such as parallel and cross-over designs.  We will also explain some of the mechanics of clinical trials, like randomization and blinding of treatment.  In the second half of the course, we will explain how clinical trials are analyzed and interpreted.  Finally, we will review the essential ethical consideration involved in conducting experiments on people.

Course Syllabus
The course will mainly focus on the nuts and bolt of clinical trials design.  Lecture topics are:
Terminology and Common Trial Designs
Randomization – what is it and how do we do it
Blinding treatment – why and how we keep everyone in the dark about the treatment
Selecting outcome – good and bad ones
Analyzing the data – principle of intention-to-treat, why it’s not crazy
Reporting the results – CONSORT guidelines, a good road map for readers and writers
Ethical issues – why they are important and what they are
Recommended Background
Student should have an interest in health sciences.  Some fundamental knowledge of epidemiology, e.g., types of bias, and statistics, e.g., mean and standard deviation, hypothesis testing, will be helpful.  

Suggested Readings
The book Fundamentals of Clinical Trials by Lawrence Friedman, Curt Furberg and David DeMets is an excellent resource but is not required. We will post some readings that are related to specific parts of the course.

Course Format
There will be 2 to 4 lectures segments each week that will cover one or two topics.  Each week there will be a quiz with up to 10 questions.  The quizzes will be graded and used to evaluate student performance.  You will have 3 attempts to take each quiz, the highest score will be used.  In order to successfully complete the class you must take each quiz and achieve an overall average of 70%.  The course will require 2 to 3 hours per week and be 6 weeks long.  There will be one week after the last lecture to complete any unfinished quizzes.

We will be posting periodic questions on the discussion forum that highlight different issues in clinical trials.  We encourage students to participate in the forum but it will not be part of the student performance evaluation.

FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?
Yes. Students who earn a sufficient final grade will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.

Will I get clinical advice in this course?
No. This course deals with principles of public health and the design of trials, not individual clinical situations.</field>

Learn and practice strategies for coaching teachers to make meaningful, long-lasting improvements in their instruction.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Teachers face a blizzard of decisions. Scholars estimate that teachers have over 1000 unique exchanges with students every day, most of which are unplanned and require quick decision making. And then there are the myriad daily decision points related to curriculum planning, assessing student work, and interactions with parents and colleagues. Amidst this frenzy, it’s easy for “bad” habits to set in, and hard to break them once they do.

The question then becomes:

How in such a fast-paced environment can coaches and instructional leaders help teachers execute changes in their practice that actually stick? 

Effective teacher-coaches are not just knowledgeable about instruction; they’re also highly strategic in their approach to changing teachers’ behaviors. That starts with preparing teachers to receive critical feedback, and then continues with a careful selection of goals and scaffolds to ensure that feedback is implemented with fidelity.

Oftentimes, teacher coaching suffers from a lack of direction, a lack of support, or both. The coach might tell the teacher to “Do X,” but then fail to articulate clear, measurable steps for implementation.  Most commonly, coaches can be overly suggestive, telling the teacher “You might do X, Y, and Z, and maybe even A, B, and C, too.” With an already very full plate, this approach leaves the teacher uncertain of what to focus on first, undercutting the likelihood of meaningful change.

Even teacher coaching that’s described as “good” can sometimes fall short of resulting in meaningful change. The coach might see and say the right things, and the teacher might be very appreciative of the feedback. But unless the coaching drives true changes in behavior, the “good” in this case could actually end up being the enemy of effective.

Match Education trains and employs dozens of coaches who provide intensive support for teachers in Boston and New Orleans. Course participants will be introduced to Match’s Five key principles of effective coaching, which strike the right balance between providing clear direction for teachers, while giving them the support they need to achieve their goals:

1)     Permission-based Coaching

Teachers first need to permit themselves to receive coaching in order for meaningful change to occur. A skillful coach needs to know how to ask for and create buy-in for this level of permission. In this session of the course, we focus on concrete strategies that help teachers receive and process critical feedback, while maintaining a “growth mindset” about their practice.

2)     Shared Vocabulary and Vision

A teacher coaching relationship must begin with a shared vocabulary for talking about instruction, and a common vision for what excellent teaching looks like. In this session of the course, we introduce a simple observation rubric and several video exercises that a coach could use with a teacher to communicate the parameters of what s/he will be looking for when s/he conducts classroom observations.

3)     Selecting and Setting Measurable Goals

Novice teachers, in particular, often describe the feedback they receive from expert coaches as akin to “drinking from a fire hose” – there’s so much to work on that it becomes difficult to identify and prioritize next steps for their practice. In this session of the course, we focus on how to analyze classroom instruction and select a single, measurable goal that addresses a particularly high leverage aspect of a teacher’s practice.

4)     Delivering Directive Feedback

We believe that teachers need to leave a coaching feedback session with absolute clarity about the steps they should take to achieve their goals. However, the clarity of those steps could easily be obscured by a coach who struggles to deliver candid feedback or to help the teacher articulate concrete, actionable solutions. In this session, we introduce and practice a protocol for debriefing a classroom observation that ensures that teachers have the direction they need to successfully implement a coach’s feedback.

5)     Create Opportunities for Practice

Great coaches don’t just leave it to chance that a teacher is ready to implement feedback after merely discussing what to do. They first try to create opportunities for the teacher to rehearse or apply the action steps in the presence of the coach before the teacher attempts to do it in the classroom. In this session, we explore different exercises for practicing action steps within a coaching feedback session. 

Course Learning Outcomes

o   To describe and analyze strategies that help a teacher develop a growth mindset about accepting and acting on critical feedback.

o   To describe and analyze tools (e.g. observation rubrics) that help teachers and coaches develop a shared vocabulary and vision about excellent classroom practice.

o   To derive clear and measurable improvement goals for teachers based on observations of their practice.

o   To describe and analyze protocols for delivering directive, actionable feedback to teachers.

o   To describe and analyze exercises that generate meaningful opportunities to practice implementing feedback. 

Recommended Background
This course is appropriate for any educator who has an interest in coaching teachers. Course participants do not need to be currently coaching, mentoring or supervising teachers.  Participants should, however, have some experience as full-time classroom teachers in a K-12 setting prior to taking the course. 
Course Format
This course will have five highly interactive 90 minute sessions that are a mix of short lectures, videos of classroom practice, reading, and analytical written exercises. Students will be assessed via two mechanisms: (1) Multiple choice quizzes that address descriptions of key concepts; and (2) short-answer analysis and description of teaching techniques. Peer assessment is required for the short-answer writing exercises. The course instructional team will schedule times after each session for interacting with students via the course’s Discussion Board.

“Coaching Teachers” will launch in January 2014. Exact date TBA.</field>

Comic books have arrived! &quot;Comic Books and Graphic Novels&quot; presents a survey of the Anglo-American comic book canon and of the major graphic novels in circulation in the United States today. Its governing question is simple: by what terms can we discuss comic books as literary art? In pursuit of that question it develops a theory of literary reading and time itself. Visit us at www.facebook.com/UCBComics</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
The comic book pamphlet developed as an independent literary form in the 1930s and early 1940s and has been a favorite of adolescent enthusiasts and cult devotees ever since. Recently, it has entered into a process of transformation, moving from a species of pulp fiction on the margins of children’s literature to an autonomous genre, one Will Eisner labeled the graphic novel. This transformation has been noted in such literary venues as the New York Times and the New Yorker, as well as in an increasing number of university classrooms and bookstore shelves. 

“Comic Books and Graphic Novels” presents a survey of the history of American comics and a review of major graphic novels circulating in the U. S. today. It is focused on three main points. First, it argues that as comics develop in concert with, and participate in literary culture, they should be considered literature. Second, it reasons that such a designation forces us to redefine our concept of literature itself. Finally, it explores this transformative literary world by arguing that comics have much to teach us about ourselves.

Recommended Background
No background reading in comics is required.  Comics are for everyone! 
Suggested Readings
In the spirit of a free course, I do not require you to buy books for this course.  The lectures and assignments are all designed to be self-contained.  Beyond the size of the class, this is the chief difference between the MOOC and the versions of the course I teach at the University of Colorado Boulder. 

I do encourage you to apply what you learn in the lectures to the comics you own, buy off the shelf of your local comic store, or borrow from your local library.  Reading as many comics as you can, as slowly and as carefully as you can, regardless of which ones, will make you a more sophisticated reader.

After week three, the lectures turn to specific texts.  If you are driven to buy some of the books, I would first suggest that you buy the following three:
1. Art Spiegelman&#39;s Maus (especially volume one)
2. Frank Miller&#39;s The Dark Knight Returns
3. Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons&#39;s Watchmen

If you still have some money burning a hole in your pocket, I would recommend these, in this order:
1. Alison Bechdel&#39;s Fun Home
2. Chris Ware&#39;s Building Stories
3. and finally, Warren Ellis and John Cassady&#39;s Planetary, and any book by David Mazzucchelli or Paul Pope.

The remaining books are: 
1. Neil Gaiman, et al., Sandman, Volume 3: &quot;Dream Country.&quot;
2. Bill Willingham, et al., Fables, Volume 1: &quot;Legends in Exile.&quot;
3. Joe Sacco, Palestine.
4. Mark Millar and Bryan Hitch, The Ultimates I &amp; II.


Course Format
The class will consist of lecture videos and powerpoints, each between 10 and 25 minutes in length. There will also be two close reading papers, graded through peer-review, a comic shop project, two tests, and a comic book project.
FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.

What resources will I need for this class?

For this course, all you need is an internet connection and the time to view the videos, write the essays, and enjoy some marvelous works of art. You do not need to purchase the comics, as the lectures and assignments are self-contained; of course, you might enjoy reading and owning the comics.

Is this course suitable for children?

Comics are written by adults and are about themes that adults think about.  This course deals with these mature, often passionate and painful, themes.  It is not for children.

But aren’t comics really for illiterates?

Comics are a vibrant art form that spans every aspect of the humanities: literature and creative writing, art and design, world history, and studies of society, gender, race, and class.  If you haven’t read comics, or just haven’t read them in a long time, you are in for a profound experience.

Who would win in a fight, Superman or Dr. Manhattan?

This course isn’t really about questions like this, so much as big questions of art, history, and the human urge to create.  If you would like to know the answer to this question, draw your own comic!

Why should I bother with the essays?

Every writer can improve.  Writing essays will develop your writing skills and help you articulate your imagination.

What are three cool things I&#39;ll learn from this class?

You will learn a mode of reading that will allow you to appreciate comics in a new depth.  You will learn an effective mode of writing that will allow you to express your thinking clearly.  Most importantly, you will also learn the power of the imagination as a force for change: Art is Generative, so there is always hope.</field>

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Since Antiquity, scholars have appreciated the importance of communication: as social beings, we cannot exist without communication. We need to interact with people around us, to make sense of the world and to position ourselves in a wider social and cultural reality. In this course, we look at how and why communication evolved as a science and reflect on today’s dominant paradigms. The course also extends beyond the boundaries of communication science itself, exploring dimensions of history, sociology and psychology. Join our class, together with people all over the world.

Introduction to Communication Science explores some of the basic theories, models and concepts from the fields of mass, interpersonal and intrapersonal communication. The course begins with a consideration of several basic models, subsequently progressing to the history of communication theory, linear effect-oriented theories, the reception approach and, finally, exploring theories on the production and reinforcement of culture through communication. 

Upon completion of this course, students should:
•	have knowledge of the history and development of communication science; 
•	have knowledge of the dominant theoretical approaches within communication science; 
•	have knowledge and understanding of the most important models and concepts in this field. 

Course Syllabus
Week 1 - Introduction to the course: some basic models of our field
In this introduction to the course I will briefly introduce our topic and discuss some basic models that will serve as guidelines to the further course.

Week 2 - A short history of communication science
This week we will explore the historical roots of the science of communication. I will talk about the development of communication theory and the evolution of the media landscape in Antiquity, Medieval and Early Modern times.

Week 3 - The linear effect-oriented approach
This week we&#39;ll talk about the linear effect-oriented approach and how it developed in the twentieth century. Evolving from a belief in all-powerful effects after World War I to a more nuanced negotiated effects perspective in the sixties.

Week 4 The reception and signification perspective
This week we&#39;ll cover some basic theories on message construction and (selective) processing.

Week 5 Communication as a social and cultural force
In week 5 we cover theoretical approaches to communication as a social and cultural force, a building block of reality and a binding element of power in society.

Week 6 Student questions and debate
In this week I&#39;ll answer some recurring questions of students regarding a variety of topics: the use of metaphors, the role of media in society, the distinction between primary and secondary research, and finally some thoughts on new media and globalization. I will also give you more information about the exam.

Week 7 Exam

Week 8 Closing week: behind the scenes of this course
Course Format
Each week of the course video lectures will be made available. After completing each lecture you will be asked to answer several multiple choice questions related to the lecture content to test your understanding of the subject.

A three-minute video only gives us time to outline a topic in broad strokes. We have therefore created a ‘Little box of nuance’ feature, in which we will add additional information, indicate when scientists have differing opinions on an issue and suggestions for further reading. If you would like to propose an additional topic, article or anecdote that you think should be included here, please feel free to share it on the forum.

The course includes an interactive forum, designed to enable students to actively participate. Visit the forum and make your contribution by opening a discussion on a particular topic or joining one of the existing discussions. We will also contribute by posting answers to recurring questions. You can also use this forum to give any constructive feedback you might have on course. That way, you can help me to learn and improve!</field>

This course examines the community context of the changes needed to promote the public’s health.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
In bringing about behavior change in public health, we often focus on the individual mother, student, or farmer. We should not forget the community structure and norms constrain for encouraging individual health behaviors. This course examines the community context of the changes needed to promote the public’s health. We begin by examining the various definitions of ‘community’ and the processes by which we ‘diagnose’ or seek to understand the structure and characteristics of different types of communities. An appreciation of community similarities and differences is necessary lest we fall into the trap of designing one-size-fits-all interventions. We need to recognize that no matter that outsiders may view a community as poor or neglected, we can find strengths and capacities for improvement in each community. Identifying community capacities and resources is the first step in facilitating community change. Different practical and philosophical approaches to change and therefore, examined. Specific to the change process is our recognition of the need for communities to participate in the design, implementation and evaluation of any intervention. We examine the concept of participation in an effort to see how different levels of involvement may affect sustainability of community change efforts. Finally a case study of a community participatory approach to onchocerciasis control in Africa is presented. Community Directed Intervention has subsequently been successfully applied to providing other essential primary health care services by and in the community, such as insecticide treated bednets, malaria treatment, vitamin A distribution, deworming medicines, and pneumonia and diarrhea case management. 

Course Syllabus

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This course will discuss the major ideas used today in the implementation of programming language compilers, including lexical analysis, parsing, syntax-directed translation, abstract syntax trees, types and type checking, intermediate languages, dataflow analysis, program optimization, code generation, and runtime systems. As a result, you will learn how a program written in a high-level language designed for humans is systematically translated into a program written in low-level assembly more suited to machines. Along the way we will also touch on how programming languages are designed, programming language semantics, and why there are so many different kinds of programming languages.

The course lectures will be presented in short videos. To help you master the material, there will be in-lecture questions to answer, quizzes, and two exams: a midterm and a final. There will also be homework in the form of exercises that ask you to show a sequence of logical steps needed to derive a specific result, such as the sequence of steps a type checker would perform to type check a piece of code, or the sequence of steps a parser would perform to parse an input string. This checking technology is the result of ongoing research at Stanford into developing innovative tools for education, and we&#39;re excited to be the first course ever to make it available to students.

An optional course project is to write a complete compiler for COOL, the Classroom Object Oriented Language. COOL has the essential features of a realistic programming language, but is small and simple enough that it can be implemented in a few thousand lines of code. Students who choose to do the project can implement it in either C++ or Java.
I hope you enjoy the course!
Why Study Compilers?

Everything that computers do is the result of some program, and all of the millions of programs in the world are written in one of the many thousands of programming languages that have been developed over the last 60 years. Designing and implementing a programming language turns out to be difficult; some of the best minds in computer science have thought about the problems involved and contributed beautiful and deep results. Learning something about compilers will show you the interplay of theory and practice in computer science, especially how powerful general ideas combined with engineering insight can lead to practical solutions to very hard problems. Knowing how a compiler works will also make you a better programmer and increase your ability to learn new programming languages quickly.
FAQ
Will I get a statement of accomplishment after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a statement of accomplishment signed by the instructor.

How is the class structured?
Each week there will be a number of videos to watch, most of which will include an in-video quiz question to answer. Most weeks there will also be homeworks (done on-line) and a quiz. There will be also be a midterm and a final exam. For those doing the course project, there will be 5 programming assignments, which you will do on your own using infrastructure that we provide.

Are the lectures available in a file format?
Yes. The slides from the lectures will be available in both annotated and unannotated form.

Do I need a textbook?
No, no textbook is required for the class. However, you may find a textbook useful as a reference or to learn more details of some of the ideas discussed in the course. There are a number of good textbooks on compilers; here are three in particular:

Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools (Second Edition)
Alfred Aho, Monica Lam, Ravi Sethi, and Jeffrey Ullman.
Addison-Wesley
Modern Compiler Implementation in Java (Second Edition)
Andrew Appel and Jens Palsberg.
Cambridge University Press
Engineering a Compiler
Keith Cooper and Linda Torczon
Morgan Kaufman
How do I ask questions?
There will be an on-line discussion forum in which students can ask questions and receive answers. While the scale of an on-line class means that often the fastest (and best!) answer comes from another student, the course staff will monitor the discussions for accuracy and to address questions where the student community particularly wants to hear from the staff.

Is the compiler project required?
No. You can take the class without doing the programming assignments.

How difficult is the compiler project? What background and tools do I need?
This question is very hard to answer as the level of difficulty will vary depending on your programming background. As a rough guide, you should already be an experienced programmer and be comfortable writing substantial C++ or Java programs; writing a compiler is not a good way to learn either programming or these particular languages. The project also makes use of software tools, so you should also be comfortable learning to use new tools on your own. It is not a problem if you start the project but don&#39;t finish it; we will just consider you to be enrolled in the non-project option of the class in this case.</field>

Overview
Why do the prices of some companies’ stocks seem to move up and down together while others move separately? What does portfolio “diversification” really mean and how important is it? What should the price of a stock be? How can we discover and exploit the relationships between equity prices automatically? We’ll examine these questions, and others, from a computational point of view. You will learn many of the principles and algorithms hedge funds and investment professionals use to maximize return and reduce risk in equity portfolios.

Topics
We start with a tour of the mathematics and statistics that underlie equity price changes, and the relationships between different groups of equities. We’ll review the most important economic theories of investing and how to create programs that take advantage of them. We’ll look at the data needed to do this, and how to manipulate it effectively. Take a look at the course syllabus here.

Important note: This is a project oriented course involving Python programming.

In this course we’ll explore complex analysis, complex dynamics, and some applications of these topics.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Complex analysis is the study of functions that live in the complex plane, i.e. functions that have complex arguments and complex outputs. In order to study the behavior of such functions we’ll need to first understand the basic objects involved, namely the complex numbers. We’ll begin with some history: When and why were complex numbers invented? Was it the need for a solution of the equation x^2 = -1 that brought the field of complex analysis into being, or were there other reasons? Once we’ve answered these questions we’ll devote some time to learn about basic properties of complex numbers that will make it possible for us to use them in more advanced settings later on. We will learn how to do basic algebra with these numbers, how they behave in limiting processes, etc. These facts enable us to begin the study of complex functions, and at this point we can already understand the basics about the construction of the Mandelbrot set and Julia sets (if you have never heard of these that’s quite alright, but do look at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set for example to see some beautiful pictures).

When studying functions we are often interested in their local behavior, more specifically, in how functions change as their argument changes. This leads us to studying complex differentiation – a more powerful concept than that which we learned in calculus. Don’t worry! We’ll help you remember facts from calculus in case you have forgotten.  After this exploration we will be ready to meet the main players: analytic functions. These are functions that possess complex derivatives in lots of places, a fact which endows these functions with some of the most beautiful properties mathematics has to offer. We’ll explore these properties! 

Who would want to differentiate without being able to undo it? Clearly we’ll have to learn about integration as well. But we are in the complex plane, so what are the objects we’ll integrate over? Curves! We’ll study these as well, and we’ll tie everything together via Cauchy’s beautiful and all encompassing integral theorem and formula.   

Throughout this course we&#39;ll tell you about some of the major theorems in the field (even if we won&#39;t be able to go into depth about them) as well as some outstanding conjectures. 
Course Syllabus
Week One: Introduction to complex numbers, their geometry and algebra, working with complex numbers.

Week Two: The Mandelbrot set, Julia sets, a famous outstanding conjecture, history of complex numbers, sequences of complex numbers and convergence, complex functions.

Week Three: Complex differentiation and the Cauchy-Riemann equations.

Week Four: Conformal mappings, Möbius transformations and the Riemann mapping theorem.

Week Five: Complex integration, Cauchy-Goursat theorem, Cauchy integral formula, Liouville&#39;s Theorem, maximum principle, fundamental theorem of algebra.

Week Six: Power series representation of analytic functions, singularities, the Riemann zeta function, Riemann hypothesis, relation to prime numbers.
Recommended Background
A willingness to remember calculus is very useful, though enthusiasm and interest in learning are more important than any prior knowledge.
Suggested Readings
You are not required to purchase a textbook for this course. All necessary materials will be presented during the lectures. However, if you&#39;d like to delve deeper into certain subjects then a book may be helpful. Here are some book recommendations:

Part of the &quot;Reasoning, Data Analysis and Writing&quot; Specialization »
You will gain a foundation for college-level writing valuable for nearly any field. Students will learn how to read carefully, write effective arguments, understand the writing process, engage with others&#39; ideas, cite accurately, and craft powerful prose. We will create a workshop environment.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
English Composition I provides an introduction to and foundation for the academic reading and writing characteristic of college. Attending explicitly to disciplinary context, you will learn to read critically, write effective arguments, understand the writing process, and craft powerful prose that meets readers’ expectations. You will gain writing expertise by exploring questions about expertise itself: What factors impact expert achievement? What does it take to succeed? Who determines success? Since personal investment yields better writing, you can select an area of expertise meaningful to you (a hobby, trade, profession, discipline, etc.) for your major writing projects, which will be drafted and revised in sequenced stages: a critical review to an argument about expertise (600-800 words); an explication of a visual image (600-800 words); a case study of an expert (1000-1250 words) and an Op-Ed (500-750 words). Your writing will be central to the course as we create a seminar/workshop structure with peer response and selected instructor feedback. 

Two overarching assumptions about academic writing will shape our work:  1) it is transferable; 2) it is learnable. Being an effective academic writer involves asking meaningful questions and engaging in complex dialogue with texts and ideas. These skills are useful across virtually all academic disciplines and they provide a valuable means for making sense of non-academic experiences as well. Perhaps even more important, though, is that learning how to write effectively does not require inspiration or genius, but hard work, reflection, and feedback. This means that, with practice, dedication, and working with others, you can be an effective academic writer and contribute your ideas to important, ongoing conversations. Let&#39;s start now.

**English Composition I has earned a Certificate of Recognition from Quality Matters, a non-profit dedicated to quality in online education.** 

Course Syllabus
Unit 1 (Weeks 1-3): Critical Review
How do we become experts? I will ask you to draft and revise a critical response to an article about expertise by one of several different authors . You will draw on your selected area of expertise to respond to the author&#39;s arguments. Specifically, we will focus on how to:
read critically;
summarize, question, analyze, and evaluate written text;
engage with the work of others;
understand the stages of the writing process;
workshop writing;
respond towards revision;
incorporate reader feedback;
integrate quotes/evidence;
cite the work of others; and
craft effective titles.
Unit 2 (Weeks 4-5): Explicating a Visual Image
What does expertise look like? How do we define it? I will ask you to select a visual image depicting your selected area of expertise and then explicate that image in order to make an argument about what expertise looks like and how it can be defined. Specifically, we will continue to work with the elements we learned in Unit 1, as well as build on them by focusing on how to:
summarize, questions, analyze, and evaluate visual texts;
argue and support a position;
use evidence;
achieve cohesion;
develop paragraph unity;
revise; and
edit
Unit 3 (Weeks 6-9): Case Study
What can we learn about expertise in a particular area? What does it take to succeed? I will ask you to research a particular example of expert achievement in your selected area and, drawing on multiple resources, make an argument about expertise. Specifically, we will continue to work with the elements we learned in Units 1 and 2, as well as build on them by focusing on how to: 
conduct research;
write an extended argument;
examine disciplinary expectations;
develop an intertextual conversation;
understand popular sources and scholarly sources;
create effective introductions; and
write strong conclusions.
Unit 4 (Weeks 10-12): Writing an Op-Ed
What do you think people need to know about expertise in your selected area? In this fourth and final unit, we will turn to a more public form of writing as I ask you to write an op-ed (opposite the editorial page) about your selected area of expertise for a publication of your choosing (you do not actually have to submit it to that publication). We&#39;ll also be working together to collaboratively crowdsource a bibliography of potential resources. Specifically, we will continue to work with the elements we learned in Units 1,2, and 3, as well as build on them by focusing on how to:
write for publics;
write concisely;
edit and proofread thoroughly;
decide whether to use active or passive verbs; and
transfer writing skills to new writing contexts.
Recommended Background
Students should have basic English proficiency and exposure to secondary-level (high-school level) English or composition 

Suggested Readings
Students are encouraged to refer to the materials in this open-source textbook for additional help with their writing: Writing Commons 
Course Format
By engaging with ~40 interactive instructional videos (each ~six-eight minutes in length), students will research, draft, and revise the following four major projects in sequenced stages and with feedback from their peers: a critical review of an argument about expertise (600-800 words); an explication of a visual image (600-800 words); a case study of an expert (1000-1250 words); and an Op-Ed about expertise (500-750 words). Smaller assignments enable students to build up to these projects; these include directed reflections, forum participation, response papers, peer review, practice quizzes, polls, discussions, and surveys. 
FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class? 
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor. 
Will I get feedback on my written work? 
Yes. There are peer evaluations of your work that are the basis of the course grade. In addition, Professor Comer and her teaching staff will model effective feedback practices so class members can respond productively to one another. We will also hold several in-time virtual workshops, and use selected student writing for examples (anonymously and with your permission).
Will this course provide instruction on grammar? 
No. Although grammar is important and resources on grammar will be provided, this course is focused primarily on how to write effective arguments. This involves asking meaningful questions, engaging with the work of others, and writing powerful prose. We will focus at times on sentence-level aspects of writing, including how to write more concisely, but our primary interest is in communicating your ideas effectively to readers through the use of argument and evidence.
Will the course be especially difficult if a student is not very proficient in the English language? 
We welcome cultural and linguistic diversity, and will tailor the course to meet the needs of learners with varying levels of familiarity and facility with the English language. Part of our work will involve discussions about how different people use language, and what different expectations people bring to writing. These conversations will be strengthened with the inclusion of people who speak a wide variety of languages. We will have an expert on English as a Second Language working with our course to provide resources, model feedback practices, facilitate productive conversations, and provide instruction at times.
Will this course be geared primarily to writing in English Literature courses? No. This course will help you with academic writing in all disciplines. We will have experts working with the course who have doctorates across the social sciences, natural sciences, and humanities, and we will address disciplinary conventions explicitly. We will ask you to reflect on how you can transfer the writing knowledge you gain in this course to other writing experiences you might have in various disciplines.
What is the song in the promo video and why is it there? Throughout the course, we will be including songs about writing. We will include links to the songs and (if available) the artist web pages on our course wiki page. The song in the intro video is &quot;Writing Backwards&quot; by the group impossible songs.</field>

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
The goal of this course is to introduce you to the basics of how computation has impacted the entire workflow of photography (i.e., from how images are captured, manipulated and collaborated on, and shared).   

The course begins with a conceptualization of photography as drawing with light and the capturing of light to form images/videos.  You will learn about and understand how the optics and the sensor within a camera are generalized, as well as learn about and understand how the lighting and other aspects of the environment are also generalized through computation to capture novel images.  

Pre- and post-processing techniques used to manipulate and improve images will be discussed.  Activities in this course are selected to give you first hand experience with the power of the web and the Internet for both analyzing and sharing images.  

This course is interdisciplinary and draws upon concepts and principles from computer vision, computer graphics, image processing, mathematics and optics. 

We look forward to your engagement and participation with both the course and its discussion forums.

	<field name="course_intro">Competitive Strategy
In this six-modules course you will learn how firms behave in situations in which strategic decisions are interdependent, i.e. where my actions affect my competitors&#39; profits and vice versa. Using the basic tools of game theory, we will analyze how firms choose strategies to attain competitive advantage.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This course is about the behavior of companies in competitive markets. Facing competition forces firms to look ahead and anticipate developments: If my rivals are likely to react to a price cut, I will have to take the expected reaction into account. We focus on such instances of “strategic interdependencies” in real business situations. 

We will first study the basic concepts of game theory as a toolbox with which we will then analyze strategic “games” in real-life settings. Rather than a set of checklists of “how-to-behave” in a number of prespecified situations, this course will teach you to think about business strategy in a systematic and exciting - and ultimately more successful - way!

We will use our toolbox to address and analyze different decisions firms take: How do price wars happen and when do they end? When should I enter a market in which firms currently make high profits? What makes strategic partnerships work? These are just some examples of the questions we will discuss during the course. By the end of the course, you should be able to apply the concepts to pretty much any business situation.

This course is complemented by Advanced Competitive Strategy.
Course Syllabus
Module 1: Take care of your competitor
Module 2: Why firms work together 
Module 3: The power of complements
Module 4: How to enter a new market 
Module 5: Why worry about research &amp; development
Module 6: Design your product wisely
Recommended Background
There are no prerequisites for participation in the course. We will start from scratch and take you there step by step. 

Some knowledge of basic calculus is helpful, and if you have taken an introductory course in business or management, or have some business experience, the examples we use during the course will be a little easier to follow.   
Course Format
Each week&#39;s class will consist of 9 lecture videos between 8 and 12 minutes in length. These contain 1-2 integrated questions per video. There will also be a quiz for you to complete at the end of each week. 

In addition, the course will contain optional case study assignments and a compulsory final exam.

	<field name="course_intro">Configuring the World: A Critical Political Economy Approach
Part of the &quot;Challenges in Global Affairs&quot; Specialization »
In today’s world, politics and economics are inextricably interconnected, but what is the nature of that connectivity? Does economics influence politics, or does the causation run in the opposite direction? What data is available to study these phenomena, and how trustworthy is it? What are the power relationships that shape the world economy today? These are among the issues that will be examined in this course.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
The course is composed of eight modules that together will introduce students to the influences that shape the world in which we live today. It will examine the forces that explain the differences between success and failure in economic development and effective government in different countries. It will view how these forces also interact in the global economy.

The course will offer two tracks. One for those following the course and taking the tests and the other for students preparing individual assignments. 



Course Syllabus
1.      Configuring the World. What do we know of the world? Mostly we know where most people live and whether they are richer or poorer. This module reexamines the patterns of world demographics and economic development. 

2.      Globalisation. Over the past half century or more, the World has become more interdependent. In the ‘hyperglobalist’ literature this is attributed to a reduced role of the state and the victory of market forces. But economic markets are political constructions, without which transactions will not happen.

3.      Trust. Underlying all human activity is the concept of trust. At the extreme, the complete absence of trust, individuals fall back on closed circles of friendship and kinship and they will ‘privatise’ their involvement in public institutions. In the ensuing uncertainty, businesses will cut back their planning perspectives and societies will start to fragment.

4.      Diversity or Fragmentation. Cultural differences can enrich societies, but under different circumstances, they also serve to undermine social cohesion, and weaken the foundations of trust.  Extremes in income distribution, whether geographically or individually, may also have negative effects for society as a whole.

5.      Governance. Governance is the channel through which trust is linked to policy outcomes, such as growth and prosperity (and egalitarian policies). Poor institutional quality undermines trust, which in turn impacts on growth and prosperity. It also affects the ability of states to fulfil their international obligations. 

6.      Economic Development and Social Change. Helping to promote economic development in other countries has been an international concern since the end of the second World War. Having seen decades of  failure of development aid to close the income gaps, the current orthodoxy is prioritizing the implementation of market oriented institutional reform.

7.      (International) Institutions. The globalized economy is controlled and regulated by a network of international organizations. There is some debate about the extent to which they serve to modify state behavior, and it is also important to remember that  they are also reflect the international power balance.

8.      Non-State Actors. Despite the focus of so much literature and analysis on the level of nation states, it is businesses that trade, not states. And it is international finance, rather than international trade, that is responsible for most of the qualitative transformation of the globalized world economy. 

Recommended Background
No previous background is required.
Course Format
The student will have short videos with in-course quizzes and surveys. Assignments  will be an important part of the quiz and are discussed in peer-groups. The assignments will allow students to refine and develop their skills in data-management and presentation. At the end of each bloc, there will be multiple-choice quizzes that will contribute to the final grade. The course will be completed with a 20-30 question multiple choice exam. The multiple choice quizzes will be randomized and  based on mastery learning.

Learn about how to make mobile robots move in effective, safe, predictable, and collaborative ways using modern control theory.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This course investigates how to make mobile robots move in effective, safe, and predictable ways. The basic tool for achieving this is &quot;control theory&quot;, which deals with the question of how dynamical systems, i.e., systems whose behaviors change over time, can be effectively influenced. In the course, these two domains - controls and robotics - will be interleaved and we will go from the basics of control theory, via robotic examples of increasing complexity - all the way to the research frontier. The course will focus on mobile robots as the target application and problems that will be covered include (1) how to make (teams of) wheeled ground robots avoid collisions while reaching target locations,  (2) how to make aerial, quadrotor robots follow paths in the presence of severe disturbances, and (3) how to locomotive bipedal, humanoid robots.

While the main focus of this course is theory, it is important to be able to map the theory onto an actual physical platform. As such, the course will provide detailed instructions on how to build a mobile robot from scratch as an optional part of the course. In addition, an introduction into microcontrollers, mechatronics, and electronics will be given so that, by the end of the course, the controllers developed in the course can run on an actual mobile robot.

The course will also feature optional programming assignments, which will focus on implementing the controllers developed in this course for a mobile robot. A MATLAB-based simulator will be available run controllers from the programming assignments on a simulated robot or on the mobile robot built in this course. As a result of support from MathWorks, a downloadable license for MATLAB and course recommended toolboxes will be available for the duration of the MOOC.
Recommended Background
Working knowledge of basic calculus, linear algebra and differential equations is recommended.

The Content Strategy MOOC is for professionals at all levels of an organization who want to significantly improve their abilities to understand audiences and develop strategic words, pictures, graphics, and videos to convey their organization’s most important goals.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
NOTE: From June 9 to July 20, Northwestern will run the Content Strategy MOOC exclusively for its alumni. If you are a NU alum and have reached this page from the voucher link, you are enrolled in the upcoming June session.  If you have any questions about the MOOC, please contact the Media Management Center at mediamanagementcenter@northwestern.edu. 

The next public session will begin in October 2014. 

Why Content Strategy is essential for professionals in any organization – business, non-profit, or government. 

Content Strategy is a conversation that provides thought-leadership. It starts a “conversation” with users and stakeholders inside and outside an organization.  Conversations are the natural way people think about complex issues. Conversations also enable people to develop “stories,” which lead to understanding and helpful mental pictures. Content Strategy practitioners are at all levels of the best enterprises – in all departments and sectors from the top leader to the newcomer in the ranks. 

In this complex information age, forward-thinking employees know that if they and their organizations are to thrive, they need to go beyond their job descriptions. They must master the most demanding communications frontier – creating engaging, strategic, honest stories and information that is valued by their most important audiences. In turn that will make their enterprise stand out. 

Regardless of their department, area of work, or expertise, Content Strategy practitioners know how to use words, pictures, video, and social and mobile media to interact with their most important constituents with trustable, actionable information that the audience values and will use. The strategic content they produce enhances the audience’s lives and deepens their understanding and engagement with the organization. 

Content Strategy is similar to the best examples of journalism, but it is done by non-journalism organizations. Content Strategy is always honest, trustable, and transparent. It tells all sides of every story it reports. Often it is also deeper and directed at topics and audiences that traditional journalism under-serves or does not reach at all. Content Strategy is not advertising, marketing, or public relations. It is different because it never pursues the persuasive goals that are appropriate in those disciplines.

	<field name="course_intro">Student Thinking at the Core
This course explores how teachers can capitalize on what students bring to the classroom - their ideas, perceptions, and misunderstandings - to advance the learning of all students in the class, a practice we call “leveraging student thinking”.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
As good teachers know, our most important resource(s) in classroom interaction are the ideas and experiences our students bring with them. The past two decades of research on learning, and more recent framings of academic goals (especially the Common Core State Standards) bring this insight to the forefront. This short course, designed for as few as four weeks and as many as eight, asks how teachers can and do capitalize on what students bring to the classroom - their ideas, perceptions, and misunderstandings – to advance the learning of all students in the class. 

Our overarching goal is to support participants in developing the knowledge and skills needed to take up student thinking in ways that enable all students to learn challenging subject matter – a practice we call “leveraging student thinking”.
Course content will focus primarily on middle grades classrooms in various disciplines, but the practice of leveraging student thinking is applicable to all subject areas and grade levels. Participants will explore the design of curricular tasks, the analysis of patterns of talk, and the use of representational tools to:

elicit student thinking,
attend to significant features of that thinking,
interpret students’ ideas within a developmental framework, and
bridge from students’ current understandings to more sophisticated understandings.
These ideas will be introduced through guided engagement with video cases. Analysis of the video cases will highlight the elements involved in leveraging student thinking, and also will illustrate the epistemic, academic, developmental and managerial “pressure points” that challenge teachers’ ability to capitalize on student thinking in constructive ways.

Throughout the course, participants will further explore and test out these ideas in their own classrooms, be they formal or informal. (A Sunday school class, a scout troop, a homeschool opportunity, or a traditional classroom environment would all be appropriate, but some kind of teaching practice is necessary to benefit from the course.)  The goal is to work on the work of teaching while teaching.

In addition, critical reflection with a group of partners is an important component of this course.  At key points, participants will be asked to document their work to share with peers for feedback. Therefore, we strongly encourage teachers to plan to work through this course in teams (of two to four people) to facilitate mutual observation, analysis and discussion. Teachers who do not have a team at the beginning of the course will be able to create a team through online forums at the beginning of the course and can exchange their teaching examples through video or narrative descriptions.

Recommended Background
K-12 teaching experience in any subject area and a commitment to all students&#39; learning and achievement is necessary background. 

We also recommend joining the course with colleagues, friends, or family who can form a “critical partnership” in thinking through – and putting into practice – the ideas of the course.
Course Format
The course will be built around teacher participants&#39; guided engagement with their own teaching practice (documented by video-recording, audio-recording, or post hoc note taking) in the company of teacher colleagues or on-line partners who serve as &quot;critical friends&quot;.  Short instructor video presentations as well as panel discussions are interspersed with video clips of teaching practice to illustrate concepts and practices. Assignments will require review of one&#39;s own and one other&#39;s developing practice.  Reflective writing on the experience of engaging in the assigned practices will be peer-assessed. 
FAQ
What resources will I need for this class? 
You will get the most out of this course if you have access to videotaping equipment (as simple as your own FlipVideo Camera) and if you engage in this course with one or more teaching colleagues. However, you can still benefit if you join us solo and if you are not able to videotape your teaching.
How can I find a partner or partners if I join the course alone? 
We will create a bulletin board that will enable singleton participants to &quot;partner up&quot; with others in similar teaching situations.
Can I get professional development credit for this course? 
This is a great question but not one we can answer. Please check with your principal or other district/school official to determine whether the kind of experience this course offers can meet professional development guidelines. You may want to propose that your entire staff work through the course together!
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class? 
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment.</field>

This course deals directly with your ability for creativity which is a critical skill in any field. It focuses on divergent thinking, the ability to develop multiple ideas and concepts to solve problems. Through a series of creativity building exercises, short lectures, and readings, learners develop both an understanding of creativity and increase their own ability.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This course will help you understand the role of creativity, innovation, and problem solving in your own life and across disciplines. It will challenge you to move outside of your existing comfort zone and to recognize the value of that exploration. What makes an idea creative, anyway? This course will help you understand the importance of diverse ideas, and to convey that understanding to others. It will cover methods for generating new ideas, increasing motivation, and ways to increase your own creative ability through assessment and discussion. 

The principal learning activity in the course is a series of &quot;differents&quot; where you will be challenged to identify and change your own cultural, habitual, and normal patterns of behavior. Creative prompts such as &quot;eat something different&quot; and &quot;do something as a child&quot; will encourage you to recognize your limits and overcome them. In addition, you are encouraged to understand that creativity is based on societal norms, and that by its nature, it will differ from and be discouraged by society; in this course, the persistence of the creative person is developed through practice. You will learn how to approach problems in divergent ways and apply this knowledge to your daily endeavors.

FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.

What resources will I need for this class?
You&#39;ll need an internet connection, weekly access to a camera or some form of digital image recorder to document your projects, and the ability to upload files to a computer. You&#39;ll need some time and enthusiasm to get out and do some different things. You&#39;ll also need time to read, watch, write and discuss. 

What is the coolest thing I&#39;ll learn if I take this class?
You&#39;ll have the opportunity to try new things and develop one of the most useful skills you can have – creativity! This course aspires to help everyone have more creative ideas, experience the world in novel ways, and find value in doing things differently. 

How is this course graded? 
This course sets out to measure your increasing creative ability through class exercises and creativity drills. Much of the homework in this course is the series of &quot;do something different&quot; activities which you will document through a written description and images. One aspect in determining the value of a creative idea is how it holds up in the social realm. Therefore, part of your grade regarding these activities will incorporate a peer grading system, where you&#39;ll be asked to evaluate the creative ideas and projects of others in the class. Additionally, your participation in promoting the most creative projects is encouraged. 

How do I draw the line between doing something different and doing something dangerous?
While you&#39;re encouraged to get out of your comfort zone and try something new each week in the name of &quot;it&#39;s for class,&quot; at the same time, these exercises are constrained by concerns of safety, legality, and economics, which are addressed in their creative process. You&#39;ll need to use your best judgment: don&#39;t do anything illegal or detrimental to others or to yourself.</field>

An unconventional approach to management strategy! This class offers students the opportunity to explore today&#39;s management practices from unexpected perspectives in order to ask provocative questions about the modern business environment. This approach will allow us to interrogate key management concepts in order to explore the thinking that informs them and, as importantly, the form of capitalism they foster.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course


This course is designed for students of all backgrounds who have an interest in how firms are governed, the forces that have helped define modern management practice, and the outcomes of that practice not only for the firm itself, but also for the societies in which they operate. For students who are thinking of a career in management, it may also prove useful as a basic introduction to some of the conceptual vocabulary and ideas behind modern theories of management. 

Using a wide disciplinary approach - from economics and history to social theory and even a smattering of biblical criticism - the course will invite students to consider several core management strategies and priorities from often unexpected perspectives in order to judge their success or failure. The key objective of the course is to bring into critical focus how we think about the function and culture of management, how managers understand their role within a firm, how they take decisions, set priorities and benchmark success and failure. 

Topics include: the function of the firm; the role of incentive; the ways in which narrative forces shape decision making, and how market relationships define the managerial culture in ways that can lead to sub-optimal outcomes.

Course Syllabus
This syllabus is final. 

Week 1 - The Lessons from Rome (I)

In Ancient Rome, merchant organisations very similar to modern firms were critical to capitalising key markets and to solving serious logistical problems to enable a vibrant trading network across the Mediterranean, including, critically, supplying the city of Rome itself with the food its citizens needed to survive. We will examine the Roman grain market and the organisations that operated within that market to ask: what, exactly, is a firm? What led to the firm&#39;s evolution? And what is the issue of agency that a firm inevitably entails?  

Week 2 - The Lessons from Rome (II)

This lecture expands upon the first discussion, drawing from the insights gained about firm organisation in the Ancient world to ask about the effectiveness of the Forced Distribution Ranking Scheme (also known as &quot;stack and rank&quot;, &quot;up and out&quot;, etc...) to evaluate and promote or terminate employees, widely used by many of today&#39;s leading corporations. 

Week 3 - What is Innovation?

We live in the innovation economy. Firms have chief innovation officers. Innovation is, so we are told, the key to securing the future. And there are quite literally millions of books on the subject of innovation. So, what does it mean? And is it a useful idea for management? We&#39;ll consider both questions. 

Week 4 - The Power of Narrative

What do Hollywood movies, the Synoptic gospels, housing bubbles, Alan Greenspan&#39;s monetary policy, and the world&#39;s worst merger have in common? 

This week&#39;s lecture will develop a reading of narrative in order to explore a common pitfall that affects many managerial decisions.

Week 5 - Is Shareholder Value a Good Idea? 

Perhaps the most important lecture of the course. Almost all publicly traded firms are beholden, either explicitly or implicitly, to the principle of creating shareholder value. This week, we look at the history of this idea, how it has become widespread as a principle of corporate governance and how it has changed fundamentally the nature of the firm over the last 40 years. We will look at who the shareholders are, where their interests lie and what they have gained from this development. We will consider the wider and long-term consequences both for the firm and society. And we will ask - is this the kind of capitalism we really want?   

Week 6 - Case Studies 

We look at the examples of two companies whose recent experiences encapsulate many of the core ideas of the course. 

Recommended Background
No background is required; all are welcome!

	<field name="course_intro">Critical Thinking in Global Challenges
In this course you will develop and enhance your ability to think critically, assess information and develop reasoned arguments in the context of the global challenges facing society today.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Critical thinking is the ability to gather and assess information and evidence in a balanced and reflective way to reach conclusions that are justified by reasoned argument based on the available evidence. Critical thinking is a key skill in the information age, valuable in all disciplines and professions. 

This introductory course will give you the opportunity to better understand what critical thinking is, and to practice and enhance your critical thinking skills. To do so, we will use the context of some important global challenges that affect us all, and to which we have no clear “correct” solutions: for example, the risk and spread of serious infectious diseases in epidemics in modern societies, the implications of increasing human population on global resources, energy, environment and climate, and the challenges of human health and wellbeing in the modern world. Possible solutions to global issues such as these are hotly debated, and give the perfect setting to practice recognizing and evaluating facts, ideas, opinions and arguments. 

The relevant background information for each global challenge will be provided to ensure that you can complete the exercises. Note, however, this course is not a course on these global challenges themselves; instead it uses the context of these thought-provoking challenges to practice critical thinking.

Subtitles for all video lectures available: Portuguese (provided by the Lemann Foundation), English
Course Syllabus
Week 1: What is Critical thinking, and why is it important?
Week 2: ‘Credibility and Relevance’: Understanding where information comes from and the nature of evidence
Week 3: ‘Assessing arguments’ 1/2 
Week 4: ‘Assessing arguments’ 2/2 
Week 5: Developing arguments
The course will provide ‘Global Challenge’ themes for students to work on for the purpose of ‘Assessing arguments’ in weeks 3 &amp; 4. We recommend that students normally select only one of the themes to focus on.
Recommended Background
There is no prerequisite to take this course. No prior knowledge in the four ‘Global challenge’ themes is required.
Course Format
The course contains lectures, quizzes and exercises. There is an additional final exam for those wanting to get a certificate of accomplishment.

This is a basic, informal and very pragmatic course, which focuses on getting you to think rationally and critically about evidence, and does not attempt to teach you about logic, reasoning and knowledge in a formal way. Short lectures will briefly present key concepts and definitions, but it is by actually doing and completing &#39;real -world&#39; exercises and quizzes, and discussing them with your fellow students, that you will learn how to think critically about the information that surround us.
FAQ
Will I get a certificate after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructors.

Do I earn University of Edinburgh credits upon completion of the course?
No. The Statement of Accomplishment is not part of a formal qualification from the University. However, it may be useful to demonstrate prior learning and interest in your subject to a higher education institution or potential employer.

What resources will I need for this class?
We will provide a list of ‘starter’ resources for each week. As the understanding of what makes a reliable resource is a key aspect of the course, you will also be asked to do your own research on the internet to find additional resources to complete the exercises.

What are the learning outcomes of this course and why should I take it?
By the end of the course you will have a better understanding of where information comes from, how to validate or refute arguments and how to develop your own arguments based on the available information.</field>

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Cryptography is an indispensable tool for protecting information in computer systems. This course explains the inner workings of cryptographic primitives and how to correctly use them. Students will learn how to reason about the security of cryptographic constructions and how to apply this knowledge to real-world applications. The course begins with a detailed discussion of how two parties who have a shared secret key can communicate securely when a powerful adversary eavesdrops and tampers with traffic. We will examine many deployed protocols and analyze mistakes in existing systems. The second half of the course discusses public-key techniques that let two or more parties generate a shared secret key. We will cover the relevant number theory and discuss public-key encryption and basic key-exchange. Throughout the course students will be exposed to many exciting open problems in the field.

The course will include written homeworks and programming labs. The course is self-contained, however it will be helpful to have a basic understanding of discrete probability theory.

FAQ
Will I get a statement of accomplishment after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a statement of accomplishment signed by the instructor.

What is the format of the class?
The class will consist of lecture videos, which are broken into small chunks, usually between eight and twelve minutes each. Some of these may contain integrated quiz questions. There will also be standalone quizzes that are not part of video lectures, and programming assignments. There will be approximately two hours worth of video content per week.

How much programming background is needed for the course?
The course includes programming assignments and some programming background will be helpful. However, we will hand out lots of starter code that will help students complete the assignments. We will also point to online resources that can help students find the necessary background.

What math background is needed for the course?
The course is mostly self contained, however some knowledge of discrete probability will be helpful. The wikibooks article on discrete probability should give sufficient background.</field>

CS101 teaches the essential ideas of Computer Science for a zero-prior-experience audience. Computers can appear very complicated, but in reality, computers work within just a few, simple patterns. CS101 demystifies and brings those patterns to life, which is useful for anyone using computers today.

In CS101, students play and experiment with short bits of &quot;computer code&quot; to bring to life to the power and limitations of computers. Everything works within the browser, so there is no extra software to download or install. CS101 also provides a general background on computers today: what is a computer, what is hardware, what is software, what is the internet. No previous experience is required other than the ability to use a web browser.

Here is another video Nick created for this class.

Course Syllabus
CS101 topics are covered with a mixture of video lecture and active lab work, all in the browser:

The nature of computers and code, what they can and cannot do
How computer hardware works: chips, cpu, memory, disk
Necessary jargon: bits, bytes, megabytes, gigabytes
How software works: what is a program, what is &quot;running&quot;
How digital images work
Computer code: loops and logic
Big ideas: abstraction, logic, bugs
How structured data works
How the internet works: ip address, routing, ethernet, wi-fi
Computer security: viruses, trojans, and passwords, oh my!
Analog vs. digital
Digital media, images, sounds, video, compression
FAQ
What is Self-Study mode? 
Self-Study mode makes all the videos and assignments available to be done at your own pace, but without a certificate of completion at the end.

Will I get a statement of accomplishment after completing the next run of the class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a statement of accomplishment signed by the instructor.

What is the format of the class?
The class will consist of lecture videos, which are broken into small chunks, usually between eight and twelve minutes each. Some of these may contain integrated quiz questions. There will also be standalone quizzes that are not part of video lectures, and programming assignments. There will be approximately two hours worth of video content per week.

What sort of written support is there for the lectures?
Each lecture comes with written document that parallels the video explanation, so there is something you can review after the lecture that includes all the examples and whatnot. Or put another way, you do not need to take detailed notes of the lecture -- it&#39;s already been done for you.

Is any actual work required for this course?
Yes. CS101 has a &quot;lab&quot; component where students play with short bits of computer code, on their way to understanding the nature of computers.

Is a computer background needed for this course?
Not at all. The course assumes zero computer knowledge. Everything you need to do in the labs will first be explained and demonstrated in the lectures.

Do I need any particular software?
Everything should work in a recent browser, so that should be simple. We&#39;ll have a list of which browser versions we&#39;ve tested before the course starts.

What computer language is used for CS101?
CS101 uses a variant of Javascript. However, the code used in CS101 is very stripped down, avoiding all sorts of boilerplate that would get in the way of learning. As a result, CS101 code does not look like full, professional Javascript code.

Is CS101 a full programming course?
No. CS101 uses code to explore the nature of computers, but does not pursue code in the depth of a full programming course. Certainly CS101 students will have a real understanding of what code is and how it works, but not going so far as a full programming course. CS101 is an excellent first step for someone who then wants to take a full programming course.</field>

Learn about the most effective data analysis methods to solve problems and achieve insight.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
You have probably heard that this is the era of “Big Data”. Stories about companies or scientists using data to recommend movies, discover who is pregnant based on credit card receipts, or confirm the existence of the Higgs Boson regularly appear in Forbes, the Economist, the Wall Street Journal, and The New York Times. But how does one turn data into this type of insight? The answer is data analysis and applied statistics. Data analysis is the process of finding the right data to answer your question, understanding the processes underlying the data, discovering the important patterns in the data, and then communicating your results to have the biggest possible impact. There is a critical shortage of people with these skills in the workforce, which is why Hal Varian (Chief Economist at Google) says that being a statistician will be the sexy job for the next 10 years. 

This course is an applied statistics course focusing on data analysis. The course will begin with an overview of how to organize, perform, and write-up data analyses. Then we will cover some of the most popular and widely used statistical methods like linear regression, principal components analysis, cross-validation, and p-values. Instead of focusing on mathematical details, the lectures will be designed to help you apply these techniques to real data using the R statistical programming language, interpret the results, and diagnose potential problems in your analysis. You will also have the opportunity to critique and assist your fellow classmates with their data analyses.
Recommended Background
Some familiarity with the R statistical programming language (http://www.r-project.org/) and proficiency in writing in English will be useful. At Johns Hopkins, this course is taken by first-year graduate students in Biostatistics.
Course Format
The course will consist of lecture videos broken into 8-10 minute segments. There will be two major data analysis projects that will be peer-graded with instructor quality control.  Course grades will be determined by the data analyses, peer reviews, and bonus points for answering questions on the course message board.
FAQ
How is this course different from “Computing for Data Analysis”?
This course will focus on how to plan, carry out, and communicate analyses of real data sets. While we will cover the basics of how to use R to implement these analyses, the course will not cover specific programming skills. Computing for Data Analysiswill cover some statistical programming topics that will be useful for this class, but it is not a prerequisite for the course.

What resources will I need for this class?
A computer with internet access on which the R software environment can be installed (recent Mac, Windows, or Linux computers are sufficient).

Do I need to buy a textbook?
There is no standard textbook for data analysis. The course lectures will include pointers to free resources about specific statistical methods, data sources, and other tools for data analysis.</field>

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This is an unconventional course in modern Data Analysis, Machine Learning and Data Mining. Its contents are heavily influenced by the idea that data analysis should help in enhancing and augmenting knowledge of the domain as represented by the concepts and statements of relation between them. According to this view, two main pathways for data analysis are summarization, for developing and augmenting concepts, and correlation, for enhancing and establishing relations. The term summarization embraces here both simple summaries like totals and means and more complex summaries: the principal components of a set of features and cluster structures in a set of entities. Similarly, correlation covers both bivariate and multivariate relations between input and target features including Bayes classifiers.

The view of the data as a subject of computational data analysis that is adhered to here has emerged quite recently. Typically, in sciences and in statistics, a problem comes first, and then the investigator turns to data that might be useful in advancing towards a solution. Yet nowadays the situation is reversed frequently, especially with the advent of Big Data. Typical questions then are: Take a look at this data set - what sense can be made out of it? – Is there any structure in the data set? Can these features help in predicting those? This is more reminiscent to a traveler’s view of the world rather than that of a scientist. The scientist sits at his desk, gets reproducible signals from the universe and tries to accommodate them into a great model of the universe. The traveler deals with what come on their way – here is the data analysis niche.  A textbook by the instructor along these lines has been published by Springer-London in 2011: “Core concepts in data analysis is clean and devoid of any fuzziness. The author presents his theses with a refreshing clarity seldom seen in a text of this sophistication. … To single out just one of the text’s many successes: I doubt readers will ever encounter again such a detailed and excellent treatment of correlation concepts. (Computing Reviews of ACM, June 2011).”

Suggested Readings
Although the lectures are designed to be self-contained, we recommend (but do not require) that students refer to the books:

B. Mirkin (2011) Core Concepts in Data Analysis: Summarization, Correlation, Visualization. Undergraduate Topics for Computer Science Series, Springer, London. 

J. Han, M. Kamber, J. Pei (2011) Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques, Third Edition, The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems, Morgan-Kaufmann. 

H. Lohninger (1999) Teach Me Data Analysis, Springer-Verlag, Berlin-New York-Tokyo.

Course Format
The class will be run using lecture videos, which are between 10 and 15 minutes in length. These contain 1-2 integrated quiz questions each. Also, there will be standalone homework that is not part of video lectures. The homework includes finding an illustrative or real-world dataset to the student’s liking, a set of assignments in applying data analysis methods to the dataset, and a final exam paper.
FAQ
1. Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?

Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.

 

2. What resources will I need for this class?

For this course, you would need an Internet connection, copies of the texts (most important  of which can be obtained for free), a computing environment such as MatLab (a Student version of which is not expensive at all) or publicly available language for statistical computing R or publicly available jpen software Weka, and the time to read, compute,  think over computing results, write, and discuss.

 

3. How can I get a data set for the class?

There are many public repositories to contain scores of various datasets, along with their descriptions and description of results found at the data, of which most popular is the so-called Irvine data mining repository. Yet I would advise first to think of a topic that you are interested at, such as football players or movie star earnings or life expectancy in different countries.  Nowadays, you could find data on virtually any topic in Internet by querying Google. For example, for the topic of life expectancy, you can find country-to-feature data tables for a list of about 200 countries on the globe along with life expectancy, national income per capita, industrial output per capita, etc. 

 

4. Would it be permitted to use Java based computations rather than those in Matlab?

Of course. Any computing language/environment will do.

 

5. Would it be permitted to use existing software for methods under study rather than code them by us ourselves?

Yes, it would. But be prepared then to describe and explain the parameter setting for the software used in your computations.</field>

This course covers database design and the use of database management systems for applications.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
&quot;Introduction to Databases&quot; had a very successful public offering in fall 2011, as one of Stanford&#39;s inaugural three massive open online courses. Since then, the course materials have been improved and expanded, and all materials are available for self-study. Students have access to lectures with in-video quizzes, multiple-choice quiz assignments, automatically-checked interactive programming exercises, midterm and final exams, a discussion forum, optional additional exercises with solutions, and pointers to readings and resources. Taught by Professor Jennifer Widom, the curriculum draws from Stanford&#39;s popular Introduction to Databases course. The material presented here is the same as the corresponding material presented on Stanford&#39;s Class2Go platform. 

Why Learn About Databases?
Databases are incredibly prevalent -- they underlie technology used by most people every day if not every hour. Databases reside behind a huge fraction of websites; they&#39;re a crucial component of telecommunications systems, banking systems, video games, and just about any other software system or electronic device that maintains some amount of persistent information. In addition to persistence, database systems provide a number of other properties that make them exceptionally useful and convenient: reliability, efficiency, scalability, concurrency control, data abstractions, and high-level query languages. Databases are so ubiquitous and important that computer science graduates frequently cite their database class as the one most useful to them in their industry or graduate-school careers.
Course Syllabus
This course covers database design and the use of database management systems for applications. It includes extensive coverage of the relational model, relational algebra, and SQL. It also covers XML data including DTDs and XML Schema for validation, and the query and transformation languages XPath, XQuery, and XSLT. The course includes database design in UML, and relational design principles based on dependencies and normal forms. Many additional key database topics from the design and application-building perspective are also covered: indexes, views, transactions, authorization, integrity constraints, triggers, on-line analytical processing (OLAP), JSON, and emerging &quot;NoSQL&quot; systems.
Recommended Background
The course does not assume prior knowledge of any specific topics, however a solid computer science foundation -- a reasonable amount of programming, as well as knowledge of basic computer science theory -- will make the material more accessible.
Suggested Readings
Detailed lecture notes are provided. Having a textbook in addition to the notes is not necessary, but you might want to purchase one for reference, to reinforce the core material, and as a source of additional exercises. Suggested textbooks and readings are listed as part of the materials.</field>

	<field name="course_intro">Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society
Combine fundamental concepts with hands-on design challenges to become a better designer.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This is a course aimed at making you a better designer. The course marries theory and practice, as both are valuable in improving design performance. Lectures and readings will lay out the fundamental concepts that underpin design as a human activity. Weekly design challenges test your ability to apply those ideas to solve real problems. The course is deliberately broad - spanning all domains of design, including architecture, graphics, services, apparel, engineered goods, and products. The emphasis of the course is the basic design process: define, explore, select, and refine. You, the student, bring to the course your particular interests and expertise related to, for instance, engineering, furniture, fashion, architecture, or products. In prior sessions of the course about half of the participants were novices and about half had prior professional design expertise. Both groups seem to benefit substantially from the course. All project work is evaluated by your peers -- and indeed, you will also be a peer reviewer. This format allows you to see an interesting collection of projects while getting useful feedback on your own project. 

Student Testimonials from Earlier Sessions of the Course: 
&quot;An amazing course - a joy to take. I will really miss checking in every week to see the latest. I learned a great deal, from the videos, [the course staff] and my fellow students. I think getting the feedback from my peers was such a great way to run the course. So many ideas, suggestions, thoughts and words of encouragement that were so appreciated. I&#39;ve been driving everyone I know talking about it all the time.&quot;  --E. Wadsworth-Jones 

&quot;When I signed up for this course I didn&#39;t know what to expect; the experience was so good and rewarding. I just loved it every step of the way. The course was brilliant, challenging and fun! Our professor, Prof. Karl Ulrich, is an amazing teacher, I loved his down to Earth approach. Participating in a tournament was also one of the course&#39;s highlights. The whole thing was a great, unforgettable experience. I wish to thank with all my heart Coursera and the University of Pennsylvania for the opportunity given to us.&quot; --D. Rosi

Course Syllabus
WEEK ONE: The Design Process 
WEEK TWO: User Needs 
WEEK THREE: Decomposition of User Needs 
WEEK FOUR: Concept Selection 
WEEK FIVE: Concept Testing 
WEEK SIX: Aesthetics in Design 
WEEK SEVEN: Brands  
WEEK EIGHT: Introduction to Supply Chain and Costing
Recommended Background
No specific background is required. Those with strong skills in visual expression (sketching, 3D modeling, model making) will find the design challenges easier than those who struggle a bit more with the mechanics of expressing an idea or building a prototype. Still, anyone with an interest in learning to be a designer (or to be a better designer) will be able to take this course. Indeed, the goal of the course is to reach both professionals as well as those who are just really interested in design. This is definitely not an engineering course. Although engineers who wish to become engineering designers will benefit from the course, this course will not include any specific domain knowledge in engineering (e.g., circuit design, design of structures, and so forth).
Suggested Readings
To get a feel for the style of the instructor and the material in the course, this book is a good place to start: Ulrich, K.T. 2010. Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society. University of Pennsylvania.

The free digital book is available at Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society.
Other highly recommended reading is the textbook: 

Product Design and Development by Karl T. Ulrich and Steven D. Eppinger

The textbook publisher McGraw-Hill has made available to you a version of the textbook Product Design and Development by Karl T. Ulrich and Steven D. Eppinger. The McGraw-Hill text (5th Edition) sells for $173 on Amazon, but the Coursera edition is $30 in eBook format. The eBook includes the chapters referenced in the course (e.g., Identifying Customer Needs, Generating Product Concepts, Selecting Product Concepts, Testing Product Concepts, and Prototyping). You do not need to purchase this text to complete this course. However, the text contains some more detailed instructions on tools and methods which you may find helpful both for this course and in your professional work.

The PDF, found here, contains detailed instructions on how to purchase the text.  However, in sum, you find it here and purchase in the normal ways. After purchase you may download the ebook to your own computer or read it on-line. (Reading a downloaded copy requires the VitalSource ebook reader. Instructions for that reader are also in the PDF.)



Course Format
The content is delivered via several 3-12 minutes videos created specifically for this course. The videos are typically explanations of concepts, and make liberal use of illustrative artifacts from many different domains (e.g., software, food, technology-based products, services, buildings). The videos are supplemented by readings from the free digital textbook  Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society. 

Essentially all of the work for this course is DOING design. Each week will include a design challenge focused on a design problem of your own choosing. By the time you have completed the course, you will have stepped through a sequence of challenges that will result in the creation of a new artifact. 
FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.

What resources will I need for this class?
You will need some physical tools (e.g., marker, razor knife, straight edge, glue, and so forth). However, these tools are readily available for very little money. 

What is the coolest thing I&#39;ll learn if I take this class?
You will learn a structured process to tackling unstructured challenges of all types. As a designer, you’ll be better able to create traditionally designed artifacts like buildings and products, but also artifacts not usually thought of as created by designers, such as services and business models.

Participants will be encouraged to make proposals for city design and development, starting with their own immediate environment.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Designing Cities is a ten-week course starting in October 2013.  Every week will focus on a different aspect of Designing Cities including: How Today’s City Evolved; The Ideas That Shape Cities; Tools for Designing Cities; Making Cities Sustainable; Cities in the Information Age; Preserving Older Cities; Designing New Cities, Districts and Neighborhoods; The Challenges of Informal Cities and Disadvantaged Neighborhoods; and Visionary Cities.  Materials will be presented by the instructors and guest faculty from PennDesign through a series of five or more modules per week, each typically 10-12 minutes long.   

The first module each week will be a roundtable discussion among professors Stefan Al, Jonathan Barnett, and Gary Hack introducing the big issues associated with the subject.  Each succeeding module will be a self-contained illustrated presentation of a set of ideas and images. There will be a list of suggested readings for those who wish to follow up on the ideas in each module.

Everyone enrolled in Designing Cities will be expected to complete 3 assignments.  These will be posted on the course site and they will be in the form of peer assessments. There will also be three sessions where we discuss a selection of the assignments that have been submitted. There will be a great deal to be learned from the ideas participants submit, reflecting cities of all sizes and circumstances across the globe.

The course concludes with a discussion by the faculty of the issues raised in the discussion groups and responses to the assignments. We are looking forward to connecting with you and seeing the issues at the forefront in designing your city.

The design and development of cities, towns and suburbs affects everyone. We want to open up consideration of the basic concepts of city design and planning for informed discussion among people of any background, who will be encouraged to use information from the course to make their own observations and comments about city design and development, starting with their own immediate environment. We especially welcome planning, landscape architecture, and architecture students and professionals, those contemplating a career in these areas, and public officials who have responsibility over city development, although a professional discipline or public office is not a prerequisite. We will make our presentations using the latest technical information and examples, but they should be understandable even if you have no previous background in our subjects. 

Course Format
The basic components of the course are:  content modules, as shown in the syllabus; three assignments, required for those who wish to receive a statement of accomplishment, and encouraged for all; participation in peer critiques of assignments; suggested readings that go beyond the materials in the modules.  

FAQ
Do I have to do the assignments?  Browsers are welcome but there is much to be gained by applying the ideas of the course to your city, and both getting and giving feedback on the three assignments.

Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing the course?  Yes, students who successfully complete the the three assignments and give feedback to others will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructors.

What resources will I need for this course?  An internet connection, of course. A computer that is equipped to create .pdf files with images and text.  A digital camera (or phone with a camera) for taking photos of your city and any sketches or drawings you make. You need not be skilled in drawing -- rough sketches are fine.  A map of your city will help others understand the areas you are talking about. 

What will I take away from the course?  A vocabulary for talking about design of cities.  Knowledge of design ideas that have been tried over the years, and their results.  Understandings of how cities differ across the globe.  Understanding of the kinds of challenges that will be faced in designing cities over the next couple of decades.  

Will the instructors actually see the materials I submit?  We have scheduled three sessions to show and comment on some of the most interesting of the assignments submitted, and will have a way that peer reviewers can spotlight those we should review.  If the enrollments are very large, it won&#39;t be possible for us to review every assignment submitted in time for the three sessions.  But the value of the assignments is in helping you think about design issues in your city.

Obesity is a common disorder, and in the United States and many other western countries more than half of the populations are overweight or obese. The prevalence is increasing dramatically, and the number of obese individuals worldwide is now projected to reach as much as 1.1 billion by 2030. Along with the increasing numbers of obese people, the prevalence of type-2 diabetes is increasing tremendously worldwide due to the westernized lifestyle. However, the sensitivity of the individual to a westernized lifestyle and development of diabetes appears to be much dependent on his or her genetic risk factors.

As diabetes is associated with a high rate of morbidity and mortality, and thereby accounts for a large part of the public health care expenses, there is a great interest in diabetes research to improve knowledge, prevention and treatment of diabetes.

This diabetes course will give you the newest state of the art updates on diabetes research in the fields of clinical aspects of diabetes and regulation of insulin secretion, epidemiology of diabetes, heritability of diabetes, genetic aspects of diabetes, prevention of diabetes and insulin resistance, molecular insulin resistance, cellular aspects of diabetes, physiological regulation of blood glucose, type 1 diabetes and stem cell research in diabetes.

In this class you will learn the basic principles and tools used to process images and videos, and how to apply them in solving practical problems of commercial and scientific interests.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Digital images and videos are everywhere these days – in thousands of scientific (e.g., astronomical, bio-medical), consumer, industrial, and artistic applications. Moreover they come in a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum - from visible light and infrared to gamma rays and beyond. The ability to process image and video signals is therefore an incredibly important skill to master for engineering/science students, software developers, and practicing scientists.   Digital image and video processing continues to enable the multimedia technology revolution we are experiencing today. Some important examples of image and video processing include the removal of degradations images suffer during acquisition (e.g., removing blur from a picture of a fast moving car), and the compression and transmission of images and videos (if you watch videos online, or share photos via a social media website, you use this everyday!), for economical storage and efficient transmission. 

This course will cover the fundamentals of image and video processing.  We will provide a mathematical framework to describe and analyze images and videos as two- and three-dimensional signals in the spatial, spatio-temporal, and frequency domains. In this class not only will you learn the theory behind fundamental processing tasks including image/video enhancement, recovery, and compression - but you will also learn how to perform these key processing tasks in practice using state-of-the-art techniques and tools. We will introduce and use a wide variety of such tools – from optimization toolboxes to statistical techniques. Emphasis on the special role sparsity plays in modern image and video processing will also be given.  In all cases, example images and videos pertaining to specific application domains will be utilized.

Course Syllabus
Introduction, Image and Video Processing vs Image and Video Analysis vs Computer Vision, the electromagnetic spectrum, applications of image and video processing
2D and 3D signals and systems, linear and shift invariant systems (convolution)
2D and 3D Fourier transform, 2D and 3D discrete-Fourier transform, uniform sampling (rectangular, arbitrary geometry)

In this course, you&#39;ll learn what every citizen should know about the security risks--and future potential — of electronic voting and Internet voting.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Computer technology has transformed how we participate in democracy. The way we cast our votes, the way our votes are counted, and the way we choose who will lead are increasingly controlled by invisible computer software. Most U.S. states have adopted electronic voting, and countries around the world are starting to collect votes over the Internet. However, computerized voting raises startling security risks that are only beginning to be understood outside the research lab, from voting machine viruses that can silently change votes to the possibility that hackers in foreign countries could steal an election. This course will provide the technical background and public policy foundation that 21st century citizens need to understand the electronic voting debate. You&#39;ll learn how electronic voting and Internet voting technologies work, why they&#39;re being introduced, and what problems they aim to solve. You&#39;ll also learn about the computer- and Internet-security risks these systems face and the serious vulnerabilities that recent research has demonstrated. We&#39;ll cover widely used safeguards, checks, and balances — and why they are often inadequate. Finally, we&#39;ll see how computer technology has the potential to improve election security, if it&#39;s applied intelligently. Along the way, you&#39;ll hear stories from the lab and from the trenches on a journey that leads from Mumbai jail cells to the halls of Washington, D.C. You&#39;ll come away from this course understanding why you can be confident your own vote will count — or why you should reasonably be skeptical.
Recommended Background
Most of this course will be accessible to non-technical students. We will provide optional materials for those with some college-level computer science background.

In this course we will learn how to design digital circuits, following an up to date and practical orientation. Although we will study the basic electronic devices necessary for the construction of digital systems, our interest will focus more on the system than in the Electronics. This approach will allow us to establish the fundamentals of complex digital systems design. 
To follow the course it is necessary to have a basic knowledge of the base_2 arithmetics and the essential elements of Electricity/Electronics (components, currents, voltages, units, etc.). There will be a “week_0” in which students may perform some self-tests to check their level of knowledge on these subjects. 
This course is especially suitable for first years ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) engineering students, and also suitable for all those who wish to be initiated in the world of digital systems. This first course in digital systems is a must for all those who wish to deepen in the computer hardware and / or in the world of application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), which constitute an important part of robotics, bionics, industrial control and other application fields.

After completing this course the student will be able to: 
Design digital systems of medium complexity.
Describe and synthesize digital systems using high level hardware description languages.
Understand the operation of computers at its most basic level (machine language).

Sobre el curso
En este curso aprenderemos los fundamentos del diseño de los circuitos digitales actuales, siguiendo una orientación eminentemente práctica. 
Aunque estudiaremos los dispositivos electrónicos básicos necesarios para la construcción de los Sistemas Digitales,nuestro interés se centrará más en el sistema que en la Electrónica que lo sustenta. Este enfoque nos permitirá sentar las bases del diseño de Sistemas Digitales complejos. 
Para seguir el curso es necesario tener conocimientos previos del sistema de numeración binario, de programación (ningún lenguaje en concreto, sólo el concepto de pseudo-código), y de las bases de la Electricidad/Electrónica (componentes, corrientes, tensiones, unidades, etc.). Habrá una &quot;semana_0&quot; en la que los estudiantes podrán realizar pruebas de autoevaluación para comprobar su nivel de conocimientos en estos temas.

Dino 101: Dinosaur Paleobiology is a 12-lesson course teaching a comprehensive overview of non-avian dinosaurs. Topics covered: anatomy, eating, locomotion, growth, environmental and behavioral adaptations, origins and extinction. Lessons are delivered from museums, fossil-preparation labs and dig sites. Estimated workload: 3-5 hrs/wk for non-credit; 7-10 hrs/wk for credit</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
In Dino 101: Dinosaur Paleobiology, students will learn about the many kinds of non-avian dinosaurs that roamed the earth during the Mesozoic Era, from 250 to 65 million years ago. Numerous topics are covered in order to deliver a comprehensive survey of this important group of animals. These include adaptations for attack and defence, anatomy,  appearances, behaviors, birth, deep time, evolutionary theory, feeding, fossilization, growth, integumentary structures, locomotion, major groupings, origins, paleogeography, plate tectonics, reproduction, species definition, stratigraphy, and the extinction event that brought their dominance to an end.

Course material is delivered in a student-friendly short-form fashion, with numerous formative feedback sections. Many lessons are delivered from actual dinosaur dig sites. Students will gain access to a number of special interactive modules designed specifically for this course. These modules will grant users access to their very own virtual fossil collection, allow them to build dinosaur skeletons and provide them with an interactive visual representation of geologic time. This course&#39;s unique lesson delivery, combined with a classic quiz structure, will enable students to quickly gain a solid foundation for understanding dinosaurs, their adaptations and behaviours, and their place in the long history of earth.

UAlberta students can earn course credit: Learn how

Dino 101 is part of an ongoing program of research into digital learning conducted by the University of Alberta and therefore anonymized data provided by Coursera and survey information can be made accessible to the researchers.


Course Syllabus
Week 1: “Appearances and Anatomy” 
covers the diversity in dinosaur appearances, and will be able to identify major features of the major groups of dinosaurs.

Week 2: “Death and Fossilization” 
describes how fossils form, how we interpret the taphonomy of skeletons and bonebeds, and looks at the possible biases taphonomic events may create in the fossil record.

Week 3: “Eating” 
looks at the variety of food types, feeding habits, and feeding adaptations amongst the major groups of dinosaurs

Week 4: “Moving Around” 
helps students understand the general modes and styles of locomotion in the major dinosaur groups. The lesson also describes general methods of evaluating hypotheses on locomotion.

Week 5: “Birth, Growth, Reproduction” 
provides a generalized life history of a dinosaur, from birth through adulthood, including reproduction. The student will be able to describe major techniques of evaluating growth stages and rates in dinosaurs.

Week 6: “Attack and Defence” 
examines the behaviours and structures that may have served for attack or defence through the lifetime of a dinosaur.

Week 7: “What is a Species” 
will teach the different ways of defining what a species is. Students will be able to compare the strengths and weaknesses of different species concepts for different situations.

Week 8: “Evolution” 
will describe the basic theories of speciation, and discusses how how these different methods of speciation may have occurred, including both hypothetical and empirical examples.

Week 9: “Stratigraphy and Geologic Time” 
provides basic stratigraphic concepts and the scale of earth history. Students will understand the evolution of dinosaurs through time, including which groups evolved when and where.

Week 10: “Palaeogeography and Plate Tectonics” 
presents the basic concepts in plate tectonics and the evolution of the earth’s surface.

Week 11: “Dinosaur Origins” 
will look at the evolution of dinosaurs from non-dinosaurian archosaurs.

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This course will teach the student how to survive when everything we normally take for granted is gone, when the structures we depend on have failed. We will examine the Disaster Cycle, particularly the Mitigation and Recovery phases. Students will prepare an extensive personal preparedness plan covering such topics as supplies, communication, food and water, shelter, security, and comfort (yes even in survival there can and should be comfort). We also look at preparedness on the institutional and government levels. 

We will look beyond these plans towards the one aspect of survival, which will enable a person to survive when all planning has failed. Disasters, by definition, overwhelm all available resources. If all available resources are gone, only one thing will keep a person alive and that is their attitude. A persons awareness and attitude, the two are closely linked, allow a person the means to remain calm, avoid panic, and draw upon resources within and outside the person to survive when their world has failed. In truth not everyone survives in extreme circumstances; people die, but, even in death, attitude, if it cannot save you, provides some degree or comfort.

An introduction to dynamical modeling techniques used in contemporary Systems Biology research.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
We take a case-based approach to teach contemporary mathematical modeling techniques. The course is appropriate for advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students. Lectures provide biological background and describe the development of both classical mathematical models and more recent representations of biological processes. The course will be useful for students who plan to use experimental techniques as their approach in the laboratory and employ computational modeling as a tool to draw deeper understanding of experiments. The course should also be valuable as an introductory overview for students planning to conduct original research in modeling biological systems.

This course focuses on dynamical modeling techniques used in Systems Biology research.  These techniques are based on biological mechanisms, and simulations with these models generate predictions that can subsequently be tested experimentally. These testable predictions frequently provide novel insight into biological processes. The approaches taught here can be grouped into the following categories: 1) ordinary differential equation-based models, 2) partial differential equation-based models, and 3) stochastic models.  
Course Syllabus
Topics covered include:
Modeling in Systems Biology
Computing with MATLAB
Dynamical systems tools to analyze behavior of mathematical models
Modeling emergent Properties: bistability in biochemical signaling 
Modeling the cell cycle

During the early childhood years children gain knowledge and skills that provide the foundation for later learning. Young children learn many of these skills through the interactions they have with their teachers. This course is intended to increase teachers’ knowledge about specific types of teacher-child interactions that promote young children’s development. The course will focus on helping teachers to offer emotionally supportive interactions to the children in their care.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
When we look at the research about what teachers actually do each day that makes a difference in children’s lives, there’s clear evidence that it’s the daily interactions that teachers have with children that are most important.  And we know quite a bit about the specific type of interactions that lead to children’s development and learning.  So this course focuses on those interactions.  By the end of the course, you should have a deep knowledge and understanding of the types of interactions that foster learning and development among your students. 

Although there are many types of interactions that are critical to young children’s development, this course will focus on one area in particular – Emotional Support.

This course focuses on Emotional Support because it is really the foundation of every early childhood classroom. In classrooms that are Emotionally Supportive children and adults are comfortable with one another and excited about learning. They look forward to spending time together and know that, even when times are tough, there will be someone there to help them.

What do you need to know to be a really effective early childhood teacher? Teachers need many types of knowledge – knowledge about children’s development, about the content they’re teaching, about effective teaching practices, about the needs and abilities of the children in their classrooms, and about themselves. In this course we’ll focus a bit on knowledge about children’s development and we’ll spend lots of time focused on knowledge about specific types of classroom interactions that promote learning and development.

Another part of effective teaching is seeing. All the knowledge in the world about effective teaching is only a piece of the puzzle. Good teachers need to see what effective teaching looks like – in lots of different types of classrooms, with lots of different types of children. Teachers tell us they don’t get nearly enough opportunities to see other teachers teach and they report how helpful these experiences are when they do get them. We’ll spend lots of time in this course focused on observing classroom videos and we’ll also ask you to spend some time watching yourself teach.

Ultimately we can’t learn to be an effective teacher without practice – we need to spend some time doing – enacting the teaching practices that we’ll learn about. Just as young children need to do things to really learn about them – you need to spend some time practicing the types of interactions we’ll be talking about.

There’s one last important element to being an effective teacher. Effective  teachers spend time reflecting on their practice. We think of this a bit like taking time to really look at your teaching through a magnifying glass – we’ll give you time to reflect on your teaching and what you have learned throughout this course.

Much of this course is based on the research of Drs. Robert Pianta, Bridget Hamre and many colleagues UVA and other institutions using the Classroom Assessment Scoring System – or CLASS(™). CLASS is an observational measure used in research and practice that defines specific elements of effective teaching. In this course you will see examples of the kinds of teaching practices assessed by the CLASS. And you will get opportunities to observe and analyze your own teaching practice in ways that have been shown to increase the effectiveness of teachers&#39; interactions with young children.

Course Syllabus
Week One – Creating Emotionally Supportive Classrooms: 

We’ll take a closer look at the importance of interactions and the power that teachers have in the development of young children. This week will include an overview of the areas and dimensions of the Teaching through Interactions Framework. For this course, we’ll focus specifically on the area of Emotional Support.

 

Week Two – Building Positive Relationships with Children – The dimension of Positive Climate: 

This week will focus on the first dimension of Emotional Support – Positive Climate. You’ll learn about the importance of Positive Climate, see examples of real teachers as they demonstrate effective Positive Climate interactions with their students, and get a chance to analyze what you’re seeing. There will also be an optional homework assignment in which you will videotape your own teaching interactions with children and then analyze what you see based on what you have learned about Positive Climate.

 

Week Three – Providing Individualized Support to Young Children – The dimension of Teacher Sensitivity: 

This week will focus on the next dimension of Emotional Support – Teacher Sensitivity. You’ll learn about the importance of sensitive interactions with children and what sensitive interactions look like in real classrooms. You’ll have the opportunity to analyze classroom videos based on what you know about Teacher Sensitivity. Again, there will be an optional homework assignment in which you will videotape your own teaching and analyze your interactions looking specifically at the dimension of Teacher Sensitivity.

 

Week Four – Supporting Children’s Independence and Sense of Self – The dimension of Regard for Child Perspectives: 

In the final week, you’ll learn about the last Emotional Support dimension – Regard for Child Perspectives. You’ll learn how important it is for young children to have opportunities for their voices and perspectives to be heard, as well as how to foster children’s feelings of self-efficacy and positive self-concepts through your daily interactions. In addition to opportunities to view and analyze classroom interactions based on your knowledge of Regard for Child Perspectives, you’ll have an optional homework assignment allowing you to do the same thing with videotape of your own classroom interactions. Finally, we’ll sum up all that you have learned about all of the dimensions of Emotional Support across the course.


Recommended Background
This course was developed specifically for teachers working with preschool children, but the information you will learn about providing emotionally supportive interactions is relevant to anyone teaching or working with young children.



Course Format
The course will consist of video lectures, which are between 6 and 15 minutes in length. There will also be a number of in-video quizzes, and Test Your Knowledge quizzes at the end of each week. There are also optional weekly homework assignments.


FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this course? 
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor. 

What resources do I need for this class? 
For this course, you will need is an Internet connection and the time to read, reflect, and participate in discussions with your peers. If you plan to complete the homework assignments, you will also need a video camera of some sort in order to record your interactions with children for later reflection and analysis. Any type of video recording device should work.</field>

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Earthquakes, volcanoes, mountain building, ice ages, landslides, floods, life evolution, plate motions—all of these phenomena have interacted over the vast expanses of deep time to sculpt the dynamic planet that we live on today.  Planet Earth presents an overview of our home, from a geological perspective.  We learn how the elements comprising the Earth formed in the guts of stars and supernovae, how Earth and its Solar System neighbors formed from a vast cloud of gas and dust over 4.5 billion years ago.  And how the atmosphere, oceans, and rocks of our planet form and change.  We will emphasize how plate tectonics—the grand unifying theory of geology—explains how the map of our planet&#39;s surface has changed radically over geologic time, and why as present-day geologic activity—including a variety of devastating natural disasters—occur where they do.  We will also discuss the fascinating interactions and exchanges that take place among land, sea, air, and life, and how these interactions they result in the great variety of landscapes—from deserts to glaciers—that make our planet unique, and influence climate change in the past and, potentially the future.  Finally, we will delve into the processes that produce the energy and mineral resources that modern society depends on, to help understand the context of the environment and sustainability challenges that we will face in the future.

Preview Lectures</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
The impact of economic forces in our lives is sizable and pervasive. For this reason, it is impossible to understand the social and economic forces shaping our lives without a good understanding of basic economic principles. This course provides a quantitative and model-based introduction to such principles, and teaches how to apply them to make sense of a wide range of real world problems. Examples of applications include predicting the impact of technological changes in market prices, calculating the optimal gasoline tax, and measuring the value of new products. 

This is a real Caltech class. It will be taught concurrently to Caltech and on-line students. This has two implications. On the costs side: the class is challenging, highly quantitative, and will demand significant effort. On the benefit side: successful completion of the class will provide you with an in-depth understanding of basic economics, and will permanently change the way you see the world.
Course Syllabus
Week 1. Principles of optimizing behavior.
Week 2. Consumer Theory.
Week 3. Producer Theory.
Week 4. Outcome of competitive markets. 
Week 5. Effects of government intervention in competitive markets: taxes and regulation. 
Week 6. Imperfect competition 1: monopolistic markets.
Week 7. Imperfect competition 2: oligopoly and monopolistic competition.
Week 8. Externalities with and without government intervention.
Week 9. Markets with asymmetric information.
Recommended Background
A strong quantitative background, and basic (univariate) calculus (equivalent of Caltech’s Math 1a).
Course Format
The course consists of video lectures, practice problems, problem sets and a final exam. Every week we will post about 2 hours of video lectures. These videos will include multiple quizzes to help you assess and push your understanding. 

The course also includes web-based labs. In each of these labs, students login into a website to participate in a market in which they trade for course credit. The labs are designed to carry out quantitative tests of the theories that we  study in the class. 

Grades will be based on your performance on the weekly problem sets, the labs, the final exam. 

You should expect to spend 8-10 hours on the course every week.
FAQ
Do I need to buy a textbook?
No, the course is self-contained. 

How much math do I need to know to do well in the course?
You should have a good understanding of basic calculus including derivation, integration, and maximization of functions. You should also find math enjoyable. If you don’t, this course is not for you.

Will I get a certificate after completing this class?
Students who complete all of the assignments for the course will receive a Statement of Completion from the instructor by email. Important: These statements are not equivalent to receiving official Caltech credit.

Can online students interact with the professor and TAs?
Yes, the professor and TAs will actively participate in the class discussion forum. We will not, however, be able to interact with non-Caltech students through other formats.

How will the final exam and problem sets be graded?
You will enter the answers in the on-line system and they will be graded by the machines.

What is the difference between the Caltech and the online version of the course?
There is no difference in terms of content or grading. However, Caltech students will have access to live office hours and will be able to interact one-on-one with the course staff during the labs.

How is this course different from a regular Principles of Economics class?
The use of calculus allow us to dig deeper into basic economic ideas than in typical introductory economics class.</field>

This course will take a non-technical approach to understanding how governments influence the macroeconomy. Topics will include fiscal policy, deficits and debts, monetary policy and structural reform. We will review some current debates, such as fiscal stimulus vs. austerity and rules vs. quantitative easing.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Developed countries are immersed in the worst crisis since World War II.  How are governments responding?  Could they do more?  These are the questions that will be tackled in this course.

 

The course begins with a review of some basic macroeconomic concepts to lay the foundation for the policy framework.  It then analyzes how fiscal policy works and what the effects of today´s outsized deficits and debts could be on national economies.  Next it moves to monetary policy and explores its drawbacks and the recourse to unconventional approaches, such as quantitative easing.  Finally, the course looks at the other policies open to governments to address a crisis, and the debate over how they have been used today.

 

Students will finish the course by trying their own hands at economic policymaking for an unidentified country, with an online simulator exercise.


Course Syllabus
Week One:

An overview of the macroeconomy and its basic variables: GDP, inflation, unemployment and the relationships among them.

Week Two:  

Diagnosing a macroeconomy.  What can the government do to stabilize the economy as it passes through the different “gaps” in the business cycle?  Do any problems solve themselves?

Week Three:  

Fiscal policy as an expansive and restrictive policy tool.  How can governments use taxes and government spending to influence the economy?  What are the drawbacks of fiscal policymaking?  When are deficit spending and rising debt appropriate, what volumes of deficit and debt give cause for concern, and how can they be addressed? 

Week Four:  

Monetary policy as an expansive and restrictive policy tool. How does it work? What are its strengths and weaknesses?  Why is monetary policy weaker during recessions, and how have central banks addressed this problem in the crisis?  What might be the consequences?

Week Five: 
Combining policies.  How do different combinations of these policies affect the macroeconomy, in the short and the long run? Trying your hand at economic policymaking.

Week Six: 

The debate over rules vs. discretion in the wake of the financial crisis.  Unconventional monetary policy tools. Evaluating your success at economic policymaking.


Recommended Background
A basic introductory course in economics or business could help, but no prior knowledge of economics is required; all are welcome.


Suggested Readings
The lectures are designed to be self-sufficient.  However, learning would be enhanced by the optional textbook, written specifically for the course and available here.


Course Format
The class will consist of lecture videos, which are each 20-30 minutes in length. These will be followed by optional, automatically graded quizzes to test student knowledge of the concepts discussed in the video and the readings. There will also be a final homework assignment and a mandatory final exam.


FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.
What resources will I need for this class?
For this course, all you need is an Internet connection, concentration and interest.  Use of the textbook will strengthen learning of the concepts.

What is the coolest thing I&#39;ll learn if I take this class?
This course will help you to be able to pick up a newspaper and understand what politicians and economists are saying on many very relevant issues...and figure out whether they are right!  It´s also fun to try a bit of policymaking on your own.</field>

We’ll explore some of the most engaging perspectives on digital culture in its popular and academic forms, and we’ll consider how our practices as teachers and learners are informed by the difference of the digital. We’ll look at how learning and literacy is represented in popular digital-, (or cyber-) culture, and explore how that connects with the visions and initiatives we are seeing unfold in our approaches to digital education.

This course will not be taught via a series of video lectures. Rather, a selection of rich resources will be provided through which you can begin to engage with the themes of the course. While the teachers will be present in the discussion forums and in various other media environments, there will be an emphasis on learner-led group formation, and the use of social media to build personal learning networks and communities of peers. On this course, you will be invited to think critically and creatively about e-learning both as a process and as a topic of study; you will be able to try out new ideas in a supportive environment, and gain fresh perspectives on your own experiences of teaching and learning.  This course is also intended to be an exploration  of the MOOC format itself.  Rather than approaching this course with the expectation of exacting teaching methods or precise learning routines, we invite all participants to collectively experiment with what the MOOC experience might be.

The course assessment will involve you creating your own digital artefact: something that is designed to be experienced digitally, on the web. It will be likely to contain a mixture of text, image, sound, video, links, and can be created in the environment of your choice. The artefact will be a representation of any of the themes encountered during the course, and you‘ll have the opportunity to use digital spaces in new ways to present this work. Our definition of ‘digital artefact’ is intentionally imprecise to invite experimentation and creativity: it will be evaluated via guided peer-assessment.

This course has been developed collaboratively by a team of experienced teachers and researchers in online education, who run the international MSc in Digital Education distance programme at the University of Edinburgh.

Recommended Background
No background knowledge or skills are required, though we recommend an interest in and some experience of using the social web to form personal learning networks, engage in discussion, and respond independently to course themes.

Course Format
This course will consist of viewing short film clips alongside associated readings, as well as discussions and group collaborations among participants.

This hands-on laboratory course complements Coursera&#39;s Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering. The course develops basic skills in constructing and measuring electrical circuits using modern laboratory instruments.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This course represents a real hands-on laboratory course in introductory electronics. In it, you will learn how to use the instruments every electrical engineer needs to know: the oscilloscope, function generator and multi-meter. You will use these instruments running on your computer to measure voltages from circuits you will build from actual electrical components with measurement systems provided by National Instruments, Inc. Students will be required to purchase hardware, software and electrical parts. 

This laboratory uses the terminology and knowledge of electrical engineering provided in Coursera&#39;s Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering. You can take the laboratory simultaneously with this course or afterwards. Once you learn the basics found in the laboratory course, you will know how to interface electrical circuits to measurement systems, be they analog or digital. You will have the knowledge to build live circuits and get them to work. No simulations!! 


This lab would not be possible without the strong involvement of our industrial partners. National Instruments makes the myDAQ interface equipment as well as the LabView and ELVISMX software system that emulates measurement instruments. DigiKey Corporation gathered the diverse collection of electrical and electronics parts into a course-specific parts kit. Mathworks is supplying the Matlab software environment for this course without charge for the course&#39;s duration. 
 

Course Syllabus
Lab Zero: Ordering the laboratory kit, opening the box and installing the software. Most electrical engineering systems combine hardware and software systems, and this kit follows that approach. Instruments are implemented in software to run on your computer while the circuits and software perform information processing. Because of delivery of the parts take time, this &quot;lab&quot; lasts for several weeks even though it is quite simple. 

Lab One: Simple DC Circuits. Using a DMM (Digital Multi-Meter) to measure voltage, current, and resistance; an oscilloscope to display time-varying voltages; a power supply to produce constant (DC) voltages; and a function generator to produce time varying (AC) voltages. 

Lab Two: AC Measurements. Characterization and measurement of waveforms using an oscilloscope. Grounding issues. Electro-acoustics—conversion of sound to voltage and back—and opto-electronics—conversion of light to voltage and back. 

Lab Three: Signal Processing I: Amplifiers. Using the op-amp in various modes for creating amplifiers. 

Lab Four: Signal Processing II: Filters. Building passive and active filters and measuring their transfer functions. 

Lab Five: Signals and Systems I. Time-domain and frequency-domain characterization of signals, especially speech. 

Lab Six: Signals and Systems II. A/D  and D/A conversion.  

Lab Seven: Digital Signal Processing I. Implementing digital filters. 

Lab Eight: Digital Signal Processing II. Advanced digital filtering. Generating signals digitally. &quot;Fancy&quot; signal processing: speech scramblers, digital music. 

Lab Nine: Final Project. A combined optical communication/pulse monitor system.
Recommended Background
Taking Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering, either simultaneously or previously. Each student will be required to order the lab kit.
Suggested Readings
No supplementary readings are required beyond the book for Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering. This is a hands-on course, where learning arises from doing!
Course Format
This lab course focuses on building and characterizing information processing systems. Videos are provide to guide you through the laboratory experiments. Each student will be part of a lab group, enabling you to consult closely with your lab partners. Each lab report will be peer graded.
FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class? 
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.
What resources will I need for this class? 
You will, of course, need an Internet connection and, most importantly, you must purchase the myDAQ kit described in Lab Zero. The kit contains a USB interface to connect your computer to your circuit, the software to turn your computer into electronics instrumentation systems, and electrical and electronic parts. The cost is around $250 (not yet determined).
What about the computing platform?
The National Instruments software only runs under Windows. The software that emulates the measurement instruments does need computing power. Our testing suggests that modern laptops can easily support the required computational load but not tablet computers. Furthermore, you will need to run Windows natively; you cannot use operating system hiding systems like Fusion and Parallels. If you have a Mac, you will need to install Windows under Boot Camp, for example. Linux is not supported.
What kind of electrical systems will I build? 
You will build analog circuits including amplifiers and interface these to digital signal systems. In the final laboratory, you will build a simple optical communication system that transmits your voice!
Can I use the myDAQ and parts kit after the course is over?
Yes!! The software license lasts &quot;forever&quot; and the parts last until you break them. You can supplement the provided parts with others for your own projects.</field>

This course offers you the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the life and work of the young Albert Einstein and especially his mind-bending special theory of relativity.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
In this course we will seek to “understand Einstein,” especially focusing on the special theory of relativity that Albert Einstein, as a 26-year-old patent clerk, introduced in his so-called “miracle year” of 1905. Our goal will be to go behind the myth-making and beyond the popularized presentations of relativity in order to gain a deeper understanding of both Einstein the person and the concepts, predictions, and strange paradoxes of his theory. Some of the questions we will address include: How did Einstein come up with his ideas? What was the nature of his genius? What is the meaning of relativity? What’s “special” about the special theory of relativity? Why did the theory initially seem to be dead on arrival? What does it mean to say that time is the “fourth dimension”? Can time actually run more slowly for one person than another, and the size of things change depending on their velocity? Is time travel possible, and if so, how? Why can’t things travel faster than the speed of light? Is it possible to travel to the center of the galaxy and return in one lifetime? Is there any evidence that definitively confirms the theory, or is it mainly speculation? Why didn’t Einstein win the Nobel Prize for the theory of relativity? 

Students may choose one of three approaches to the course: a more quantitative approach, a more qualitative approach, or an auditing approach. The more quantitative approach will include weekly problem sets, while the more qualitative approach will include a creative project relating to the young Einstein and/or the special theory of relativity. 
Course Syllabus
Week One (Einstein in Context): Einstein quotes of the week; a thought experiment involving relativity; physics and Einstein circa 1900. 

Week Two (Events, Clocks, and Reference Frames): Einstein quotes of the week; synchronizing clocks; the famous June 1905 paper; thinking more deeply about events and observers; understanding inertial frames of reference; spacetime diagrams; the Galilean transformation; Einstein&#39;s starting point: the two postulates.

Week Three (Ethereal Problems and Solutions): Einstein quotes of the week; a few words about waves; the luminiferous ether; the Michelson-Morley experiment vs. stellar aberration; how do you solve a problem like the ether?; the solutions of Fitzgerald, Lorentz, Poincare, and Einstein. 

Week Four (The Weirdness Begins): Einstein quotes of the week; the light constancy principle; time and length are suspect; what isn&#39;t suspect; exploring the Lorentz factor; the miracle of the muon. 

Week Five (Spacetime Switching): Einstein quotes of the week; the Lorentz transformation; leading clocks lag; the ultimate speed limit. 

Week Six (Breaking the Spacetime Speed Limit?): Einstein quotes of the week; spacetime diagrams revisited; regions of spacetime; cause and effect, or vice versa?; faster than light paradoxes. 

Week Seven (Paradoxes to Ponder): Einstein quotes of the week; the pole-in-the-barn paradox; the spaceships-on-a-rope paradox; how length contraction actually works; the twin paradox. 

Week Eight (To the Center of the Galaxy and Back): Einstein quotes of the week; traveling the galaxy in one lifetime; the reception of relativity; Einstein&#39;s Nobel Prize and the nature of genius; relativity beyond science. 
Recommended Background
No prior knowledge is required. Anyone who is willing to engage with the material is welcome. (For students choosing the more quantitative approach, a familiarity with basic algebra will be helpful. But a brief math review will be provided.) 
Suggested Readings
Although the course is designed to be self-contained, it is recommended (but not required) that you read the following profile: &quot;Young Einstein: From the Doxerl Affair to the Miracle Year,&quot; by L. Randles Lagerstrom, available for US$2.99 from Amazon Direct Publishing (http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BKKHS4U). You may also download the free software for viewing it here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=1000493771. (Versions are available for PCs, Macs, tablets, and smart phones.) 
Course Format
Students may choose one of three approaches to the course: a more quantitative approach, a more qualitative approach, or an auditing approach. The more quantitative approach will include weekly problem sets, while the more qualitative approach will include a creative project relating to the young Einstein and/or the special theory of relativity. (Students who choose the quantitative approach may also do a creative project if they wish.) 

The more quantitative approach is designed for those students who desire the deepest understanding of the special theory of relativity (within the introductory context of this course). Although one can gain a good understanding of the theory via a qualitative approach, the theory is ultimately a mathematical theory. The mathematics required, however, is not advanced. A familiarity with basic algebra will suffice. (For those whose knowledge is rusty, a review of the math needed is provided in a video clip.) The primary assignments for students who take this approach will be to watch lecture videos each week, take an assessment quiz for each video, take a weekly review quiz, and work on weekly problem sets. 

The more qualitative approach is designed for those students who desire a deeper understanding of Einstein and the special theory of relativity, focusing on the concepts and results. The primary assignments for students who take this approach will be to watch lecture videos each week, take an assessment quiz for each video, and take a weekly review quiz. (Though the videos will cover quantitative aspects of the theory, the quizzes will focus on the concepts and results.) Students will also complete a creative project relating to the young Einstein and/or the special theory of relativity (e.g., a video, poem, musical piece, artwork, animation, etc.). The creative project may be instructional, humorous, serious, or dramatic, or some combination thereof. Further guidelines will be given in a later handout. 

The auditing approach is designed for those students who want to learn more about Einstein and the special theory of relativity, but may not want to complete all the assignments in one of the other approaches.
FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.

What resources will I need for this class?
For this course, all you need is an Internet connection and the willingness to think.

What is the coolest thing I&#39;ll learn if I take this class? Learning how an unknown patent clerk came up with the special theory of relativity is certainly a fascinating story. And there are many cool things we will learn that come out of the theory itself, such as that one person can age significantly more slowly than another, that it&#39;s possible to travel to the center of the galaxy and back in one lifetime, and that time travel into the future is possible. But perhaps the coolest thing is simply to learn more about, in Einstein&#39;s words, &quot;the mystery ... of the marvelous structure of reality.&quot;</field>

How did life emerge on Earth? How have life and Earth co-evolved through geological time? Is life elsewhere in the universe? Take a look through the 4-billion-year history of life on Earth through the lens of the modern Tree of Life.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
The pioneering work of Professor Carl Woese on the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign campus has revolutionized our understanding of the fundamental structure and evolutionary relatedness of all living entities on Earth. This has resulted in a new &quot;Tree of Life&quot; and a first ever understanding of what life looked like before the base of the root of the Tree had evolved. 

Although these concepts from Woese&#39;s work are central to cutting-edge genome-enabled research in all fields from medicine to energy, these understandings are currently only minimally (if at all) taught in classrooms around the world. 

This course will evaluate the entire history of life on Earth within the context of our cutting-edge understanding of the Tree of Life. This includes reconnaissance of ancient primordial life before the first cell had evolved, the entire ~4-billion-year development of single- and multi-celled life through the lens of the Tree of Life, and the influence of Earth system processes (meteor impacts, volcanoes, ice sheets) on shaping and structuring the Tree.  This synthesis emphasizes the universality of the emergence of life as a prelude for the search for extraterrestrial life.

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Join internationally-acclaimed researcher and award-winning educator Richard Alley in an exploration of the role of energy in our environment and our future. Energy use has done great good for humans by giving those in the developed world the equivalent of 100 energy &quot;serfs&quot; to do our bidding, making up roughly 10% of the economy, and powering most of the economy.  However, the unintended consequences of energy use are affecting people around the world and changing the climate in ways that will make life much harder.  Numerous options exist for development of a sustainable energy system that provides a stronger economy, more jobs, and greater security that is more consistent with ethical principles.  The course explores these issues.
 
“Energy, the Environment, and Our Future” will combine student-centered instructional materials and film clips from the PBS TV series Earth: The Operators&#39; Manual, also hosted by Richard Alley, to tell the history, present, and possible futures of human energy use.

FAQ
What is Common Law? 
Historically the common law originated in England in the Kings Courts and emerged from the Kings Judges who travelled round the country adopting what they considered to be the best legal rules from each area. It has developed into a body of law which has evolved through the development of case law.

Will this cover other jurisdictions?
English Common Law underpins the law in many Commonwealth jurisdictions which in turn have contributed to the evolution of the common law.

Will this course count towards the study of a qualifying law degree?
No. Most jurisdictions will have their own rules regarding what is required to qualify as a solicitor or a barrister and you should refer to the appropriate bodies in the country where you wish to practice.

Where can I find out about more information regarding this subject and the University of London programmes?

	<field name="course_intro">Beyond Silicon Valley: Growing Entrepreneurship in Transitioning Economies
Explore how communities in transitioning economies around the world are working to enable the growth of entrepreneurship when the resources from the private sector alone are limited.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
The path for entrepreneurs to grow their companies outside of well-developed entrepreneurial ecosystems like Silicon Valley is challenging. Most markets around the world do not look like Silicon Valley, and they never will. But there are other models to support new businesses. In transitioning markets (where entrepreneurs do not have much access to private sector financing), government officials, donors, and business leaders are experimenting with creative approaches to support the growth of entrepreneurs. Northeast Ohio, whose largest city is Cleveland, is one such community. During our time together in this course, we will be exploring some of these innovative approaches. 

A massive intervention of government and donor resources in Northeast Ohio has been in place for over ten years. In that time, Northeast Ohio has experienced success (including job creation and follow-on funding) with alternative methods of financing startups, but it has not been easy. Yes, some progress has been made, but whether or not they&#39;ve hit on ultimate success has yet to be determined. A dynamic entrepreneurial ecosystem takes many years, even decades, to develop. Government officials and donors typically are looking for shorter term success with their support programs which makes long-term support for entrepreneurship challenging. 

During this course, we will hear from entrepreneurs who have launched products and services ranging from medical devices to LED lights to whiskey. You will learn how these entrepreneurs engaged with resources made available to them through a variety of programs and intermediary organizations. We have chosen to talk with many business people that are still in the process of developing their companies and whose ultimate success or failure is still to be determined. 

In addition to learning about Cleveland&#39;s attempts to support entrepreneurship, you will also be hearing in the lectures from leaders in selected markets around the world including Greece, Vietnam, Tunisia, Argentina, Rwanda and China about how they are working to support the growth of start-up companies.

One of our goals is to learn from you how different communities around the world are approaching implementing strategies and methods to support businesses. Taking what we&#39;ve learned from our examples in class, I will ask you to reflect on how to best grow entrepreneurship where you live. I am excited to use this global platform to create a dialogue where information flows in multiple directions. 

Most MOOCs rebroadcast professors’ lectures, but this course will be different. Don’t expect to see me standing in front of the camera, talking and lecturing every week. Instead, the lectures will be relatively short in length and will have more of the feel of an engaging documentary than a static classroom setting. We will also be providing you with opportunities for live engagement each week with the featured entrepreneurs and thought leaders through a number of interactive sessions during the course.
Course Syllabus
Each session, we will feature a different entrepreneur from Northeast Ohio and look at how government and donor organizations combined with private investment to help them grow their companies. We will examine why the various programs and organizations were put in place to support entrepreneurs, how the success of these initiatives are measured, and where there are challenges. We will also provide different perspectives from international entrepreneurs and thought leaders who will compare and contrast their experience on a particular topic with their counterparts in Northeast Ohio. We will cover the following topics during the course:
Government Support
Engaging Philanthropy and Donors
Creating Intermediary Organizations
Leveraging Anchor Institutions
Seed Acceleration
Fostering Angel Investment
Access to Venture Capital
Recommended Background
There is no specific background needed to take this course, but having what I call an “entrepreneurial mindset” would be useful. The course is designed for anyone interested in learning more about how communities are creatively supporting the growth of entrepreneurship around the world. We hope that the mix of participants will include entrepreneurs, policy makers, and business leaders.

Suggested Readings
You will not be required to purchase any books for the course as all of the reading assignments will be articles that are available on the Internet for free.
Course Format
The course will feature one, two or three video lectures per week (10-12 minutes each). There will be weekly quizzes covering materials from the lectures and selected readings as well as personal learning assignments (PLAs).  There is also one action learning assignment (ALA) which involves interviewing entrepreneurs/thought leaders in your community which will be peer reviewed.  You will also be required to post regularly in Coursera&#39;s discussion forums and complete surveys to reflect on how the lessons from the lectures and readings apply to supporting entrepreneurship in their home communities. There will also be a final, peer reviewed project where students will profile an entrepreneur in their community, detail the resources they are using to grow their company, describe how they have faced challenges and propose solutions based on what we discuss during the course (and may choose to include a video submission as part of the assignment).

We will be providing you with opportunities for weekly live engagement with the entrepreneurs and thought leaders that will be featured in the course. We will be varying the times of these interactive sessions to try and accommodate as many of you as possible from around the world in the discussions.
FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class? 
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.

What resources will I need for this class? 
You need an Internet connection. Also, while not required, I am hoping that participants can submit a short video (2 minutes) to accompany their final project. I recognize that not all students have access to a camera or smart phone so this video submission will be optional. 

What is the coolest thing I&#39;ll learn if I take this class? 
The greatest thing about entrepreneurs is that they are crazy enough not to listen to the skeptics who tell them that the majority of new businesses will fail. They believe that they will succeed in spite of the odds. I think you will learn in this course that if you combine the optimism of entrepreneurs with sound, thoughtful support programs (that have resources behind them), your community will increase its odds of having more of its entrepreneurs succeed in launching successful companies.</field>

Malaria, HIV/AIDS, Influenza, Measles - we’re in a constant battle against infectious diseases. This is a course about the dynamics of such diseases - how they emerge, how they spread around the globe, and how they can best be controlled.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Not so long ago, it was almost guaranteed that you would die of an infectious disease. In fact, had you been born just 150 years ago, your chances of dying of an infectious disease before you&#39;ve reached the tender age of 5 would have been extremely high. 
 
Since then, science has come a long way in understanding infectious diseases - what they are, how they spread, and how they can be prevented. But diseases like HIV/AIDS, Malaria, Tuberculosis, or the flu are still major killers worldwide, and novel emerging diseases are a constant threat to public health. In addition, the bugs are evolving. Antibiotics, our most potent weapon against bacterial infections, are losing their power because the bacteria are becoming resistant. In this course, we&#39;ll explore the major themes of infectious diseases dynamics.

After we’ve covered the basics, we&#39;ll be looking at the dynamics of the flu, and why we&#39;re worried about flu pandemics. We&#39;ll be looking at the dynamics of childhood diseases such as measles and whooping cough, which were once considered almost eradicated, but are now making a comeback. We&#39;ll explore Malaria, and use it as a case study of the evolution of drug resistance. We&#39;ll even be looking at social networks - how diseases can spread from you to your friends to your friends&#39; friends, and so on. And of course we’ll be talking about vaccination too. We’ll also be talking about how mobile phones, social media and crowdsourcing are revolutionizing disease surveillance, giving rise to a new field of digital epidemiology. And yes, we will be talking about Zombies - not human zombies, but zombie ants whose brains are hijacked by an infectious fungus. 

And there&#39;s one more thing: during the course, we&#39;ll be running a massive online epidemic with you, the participants - virtually, of course. You can signup for this epidemic game online, at www.moocdemic.com. 

We&#39;re looking forward to having you join us for an exciting course!
Course Syllabus
This course will cover key concepts that relate to the emergence, the spread, and the control of infectious disease epidemics.

We&#39;ll cover various broad topics, including:
The basics: history of infectious diseases, basic concepts of disease dynamics, parasite diversity, evolution &amp; ecology of infectious diseases
Emergence of diseases: The basic reproductive number, critical community size, epidemic curve, zoonoses, spill over, human / wildlife interface, climate change, hot zones, pathology
Spread of diseases: transmission types (droplets, vectors, sex), superspreading, diffusion, social networks, nosomical transmission, manipulation of behavior
Control of diseases: drug resistance, vaccination, herd immunity, quarantines, antibiotics, antivirals, health communication, ethical challenges of disease control
The future of infectious diseases: Evolution of virulence, emergence of drug resistance, eradication of diseases, medicine &amp; evolution, crop diseases &amp; food security, digital epidemiology
Recommended Background
No background is required; all are welcome.
Suggested Readings
We will provide you with links to relevant scientific articles in the field that are freely available as open access articles. Examples:

Each mammalian cell has the same genes, yet performs distinct functions. This is achieved by epigenetic control of gene expression; the switching on and switching off of genes. This course will cover the principles of epigenetic control of gene expression, how epigenetic control contributes to cellular differentiation and development, and how it goes wrong in disease.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
While the human genome sequence has transformed our understanding of human biology, it isn’t just the sequence of your DNA that matters, but also how you use it! How are some genes activated and others are silenced? How is this controlled? The answer is epigenetics.  

Epigenetics has been a hot topic for research over the past decade as it has become clear that aberrant epigenetic control contributes to disease (particularly to cancer). Epigenetic alterations are heritable through cell division, and in some instances are able to behave similarly to mutations in terms of their stability. Importantly, unlike genetic mutations, epigenetic modifications are reversible and therefore have the potential to be manipulated therapeutically. It has also become clear in recent years that epigenetic modifications are sensitive to the environment (for example diet), which has sparked a large amount of public debate and research.

This course will give an introduction to the fundamentals of epigenetic control. We will examine epigenetic phenomena that are manifestations of epigenetic control in several organisms, with a focus on mammals. We will examine the interplay between epigenetic control and the environment and finally the role of aberrant epigenetic control in disease.

Course Syllabus

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Quantum physics is the foundation for much of modern technology, provides the framework for understanding light and matter from the subatomic to macroscopic domains, and makes possible the most precise measurements ever made.  More than just a theory, it offers a way of looking at the world that grows richer with experience and practice.  Our course will provide some of that practice and teach you &quot;tricks of the trade&quot; (not found in textbooks) that will enable you to solve quantum-mechanical problems yourself and understand the subject at a deeper level.

The basic principles of quantum physics are actually quite simple, but they lead to astonishing outcomes.  Two examples that we will look at from various perspectives are the prediction of the laser by Albert Einstein in 1917 and the prediction of antimatter by Paul Dirac in 1928.  Both of these predictions came from very simple arguments in quantum theory, and led to results that transformed science and society.  Another familiar phenomenon, magnetism, had been known since antiquity, but only with the advent of quantum physics was it understood how magnets worked, to a degree that made possible the discovery in the 1980’s of ultrastrong rare-earth magnets.  However, lasers, antimatter and magnets are areas of vibrant research, and they are all encountered in the new field of ultracold atomic physics that will provide much of the material of “Exploring Quantum Physics”.

Richard Feynman once said, “I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.”  We say, that’s no reason not to try! What Feynman was referring to are some of the “spooky” phenomena like quantum entanglement, which are incomprehensible from the standpoint of classical physics. Even though they have been thoroughly tested by experiment, and are even being exploited for applications such as cryptography and logic processing, they still seem so counterintuitive that they give rise to extraordinary ideas such as the many-world theory. Quantum physics combines a spectacular record of discovery and predictive success, with foundational perplexities so severe that even Albert Einstein came to believe that it was wrong.  This is what makes it such an exciting area of science!

This course will cover many aspects of equine nutrition ranging from anatomy and physiology of the gastrointestinal tract to dietary management of horses/ponies affected with nutrition-related disorders. This is course is designed for self-directed study with minimal tutor input, and as such emphasis is placed upon peer discussions of the topics presented in each section of the course. This course is not designed to have a large amount of tutor input as this is an open access course that attracts tens of thousands of participants. However, tutors will endeavour to answer the main queries relating to the understanding of the lecture materials and to provide a summary of the key questions raised in each of the weekly topics and clarification of any misunderstandings.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This course is designed to provide knowledge of equine digestion and nutrition for those with an interest in this area. The anatomy and physiology of the equine alimentary canal will be studied to provide students with an understanding of the equine digestive system.  Nutrient sources for horses will be discussed, with emphasis placed on the health and welfare issues surrounding the inclusion of various types of feedstuffs in equine diets.  Students will also discuss recommendations on rations for horses and ponies performing various activities and should feel better equipped to make judgements on rations for horses and ponies, in health and disease.
Course Syllabus
Week 1: Anatomy and physiology of the equine gastrointestinal tract
The expectation is that the course participants will come from varied backgrounds in relation to their previous experience of gastrointestinal tract anatomy and physiology.  Consequently, this course begins with consideration of digestive anatomy and physiology in equids and will consider nutrient digestion in the various segments of the equine gastrointestinal tract. 

Week 2: Feed Composition
The learning materials during this period will focus on the composition of feedstuffs for horses and the factors that affect the composition of feedstuffs.  There will also be information on how feedstuffs are evaluated.  Discussion should focus on how the composition of feedstuffs affects their digestibility.  

Week 3: Equine nutrient sources 
This part of the course will consider various nutrient sources for equids. Various feedstuffs that are used in equine diets will be discussed, with emphasis placed on the health and welfare issues surrounding the inclusion of these in equine diets. 

Week 4: Equine dietary management
This week of the course will explore the dietary management of equids.  Discussions should focus around considering how modern feeding practices do not always consider the anatomy and physiology of the equine digestive tract. 

Week 5: Equine clinical nutrition
This part of the course will focus on feeding strategies for the management and prevention of some nutrition-related diseases/disorders in equids; for example, obesity, laminitis, older horses with dental issues etc. Discussions should focus on the dietary management of individuals affected with nutrition-related problems.
Recommended Background
No background in equine nutrition is required.

Ahead of the elections to the European Parliament, take a chance to learn about the European Union, how it works, why it matters and what it can offer you! Regardless of where you live, the EU not only affects your life but may also transform it. This course aims at empowering you, your family, business and community in Europe and beyond and will enable you to discover jobs and paths you were not aware of. Des sous-titres sont proposés en français.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Regardless of where you live, the European Union has a large, yet often unnoticed, impact on many aspects of your everyday life. Whether you are traveling, eating, working, doing business, shopping, surfing the Internet or breathing, all these activities are largely shaped by the EU.  As a result no global citizen, business leader, lawmaker, lobbyist or student can effectively operate in Europe or in the world without a solid understanding of this unique laboratory of integration. While the EU is often depicted as a monstrous bureaucratic creature, condemned to irrelevance by the emerging economies, it remains the most accomplished experiment of economic, social and political integration in human history. In 50 years the EU accomplished what other countries took centuries to realize.

Given its inherent complexities, Understanding Europe aims at popularizing the intricacies of the European Union system to promote greater awareness of the opportunities it offers you. Ultimately, you will not only better grasp the applicable framework for any European economic or social activity you engage in, but you will also participate on the EU stage. By confronting you with several current EU policy proposals, you will be able to ‘have a say’ in the EU policymaking process. We want to empower you as a citizen and business operator to maximize your rights and opportunities in today’s Europe.

Understanding Europe is structured upon some basic yet critical questions about the EU’s purpose and legitimacy : why does the EU exist? How does it work? What can it offer you? The course then analyzes the European public sphere by focusing on its main actors (the European Parliament, the Commission, the Council, the Court of Justice of the EU) and the role European citizens play in influencing Europe. We then move to the Union’s powers (what can the EU do? How far can it go? Do Members States have some instruments to “block” EU action? Can EU citizens challenge EU action?) by discussing the limits to its action and describing some of its policies. The course then analyzes the role and opportunities citizens and all stakeholders may have in shaping EU policies through public consultation, the European Citizens Initiative and other forms of participatory democracy. In a further step, we will analyze what the EU is doing for you regardless of where you are based in the world. Finally, by taking stock of what you have learned in the previous weeks, we will look at what you can do for and in Europe.

Throughout the whole course, participants will be confronted with real-life examples of EU action. EU affairs professionals will share their personal EU experiences and tell us about their EU jobs. You can interact with the instructor and other participants, share your opinions, question the instructor’s assumptions and hence shape the course’s content. 

Course Syllabus
Week 1: Why the European Union?

Setting the scene. An overview of the EU’s impact on your daily life, taking a critical perspective on the EU’s purpose but also highlighting the opportunities it offers.

Week 2: Who is the European Union?

Putting a face on the EU. Who is it? Who are its main actors? By whom is it composed?­ You will identify who decides in Europe and learn how to interact to its main actors.

Week 3: What the EU can do?

Analyzing the EU’s powers. What can it do? How far can it go? In which policies is it involved? The EU’s major fields of intervention. What does the EU do for trade, agriculture and innovation?

Week 4: How does the EU work?

The EU’s means of action. How does it work? Who does what? What are the strengths and weaknesses?

Week 5: What can the EU do for you?

From freedom of movement to funding opportunities, immigration policies, establishment, level playing field through competition law, getting you a job.

Week 6: What you can do for Europe?

The initiatives and instruments fostering civic engagement in the EU (public consultations, ECIs, Ombudsman, etc). In other words, the toolbox of the empowered citizen.

The discovery of extra-solar planets orbiting other stars has been one of the major breakthroughs in astronomy of the past decades, changing our view on the formation of planetary systems, mainly drawn from the observation of the Solar System. Today, over 860 exoplanets are known and the Kepler satellite has recently identified over 2700 additional candidates, most of them awaiting for confirmation. We have learned that exoplanets are extremely common objects in the Universe and that planetary systems are much more diverse than originally predicted. 

Our knowledge about exoplanets has dramatically increased thanks to the systematic monitoring of stars in the solar neighborhood by radial velocities, photometry, microlensing, and recently direct imaging, bringing valuable constraints to planet formation theories, as well as to models of planet interior structure, and atmosphere physics. In this course, we will review the main discoveries, describing the different approaches to detect exoplanets and characterise their orbital and physical properties.

We understand the world — and our selves — through stories. Then some of those hopes and fears become the world.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Fantasy is a key term both in psychology and in the art and artifice of humanity. The things we make, including our stories, reflect, serve, and often shape our needs and desires. We see this everywhere from fairy tale to kiddie lit to myth; from &quot;Cinderella&quot; to Alice in Wonderland to Superman; from building a fort as a child to building ideal, planned cities as whole societies. Fantasy in ways both entertaining and practical serves our persistent needs and desires and illuminates the human mind. Fantasy expresses itself in many ways, from the comfort we feel in the godlike powers of a fairy godmother to the seductive unease we feel confronting Dracula. From a practical viewpoint, of all the fictional forms that fantasy takes, science fiction, from Frankenstein to Avatar, is the most important in our modern world because it is the only kind that explicitly recognizes the profound ways in which science and technology, those key products of the human mind, shape not only our world but our very hopes and fears. This course will explore Fantasy in general and Science Fiction in specific both as art and as insights into ourselves and our world. 

Work Expectations
For further information about the coursework, please see the Work Expectations page.
Course Syllabus
This course comprises ten units. Each will include a significant reading, typically a novel or a selection of shorter works. I will offer video discussions of each of the readings and also of more general topics in art and psychology that those readings help illuminate. Each unit will include online quizzes and ask you to write a brief essay offering your own insights into the reading. In order, the units are:
Grimm — Children&#39;s and Household Tales
Carroll — Alice&#39;s Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass
Stoker — Dracula
Shelley — Frankenstein
Hawthorne &amp; Poe — Stories and Poems
Wells — The Island of Dr. Moreau, The Invisible Man, &quot;The Country of the Blind,&quot; &quot;The Star&quot;
Burroughs &amp; Gilman — A Princess of Mars &amp; Herland
Bradbury — The Martian Chronicles
LeGuin — The Left Hand of Darkness
Doctorow — Little Brother
In Unit I, the specific stories are the ones in the Lucy Crane translation (1886) which was published by Dover and is available online through Project Gutenberg. In Unit V, the specific readings are: Hawthorne&#39;s &quot;The Birthmark,&quot; &quot;Rappaccini&#39;s Daughter,&quot; &quot;Dr. Heidegger&#39;s Experiment,&quot; and &quot;The Artist of the Beautiful&quot;; Poe&#39;s &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher,&quot; &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart,&quot; &quot;The Black Cat,&quot; &quot;The Oval Portrait,&quot; &quot;The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,&quot; &quot;The Bells,&quot; &quot;The Raven,&quot; &quot;Annabel Lee.&quot; All the readings except Ray Bradbury&#39;s The Martian Chronicles and Ursula K. LeGuin&#39;s The Left Hand of Darkness will be available online at no charge.

Recommended Background
There are no prerequisites for this course.  However, the course will be conducted at the level expected of advanced undergraduate students.  Therefore, for all participants, reading comfortably in English at the undergraduate college level is desirable.  For those also participating in the writing and written responses, which is recommended, some experience in writing about literature is desirable. (A Note on Reading in Translation.)
Suggested Readings
I do not ask participants in this course to use any specific editions. However, for some works I believe some editions are better than others. For example, some editions of The Island of Dr. Moreau omit Charles Edward Prendick&#39;s &quot;Introduction&quot;; however, since that &quot;Introduction&quot; was actually written by H. G. Wells and included in the original publication of the book, it should not be omitted. For some works, I believe that a printed text is preferable. For example, the paper versions of Alice in Wonderland printed with Through the Looking-Glass along with James Tenniel&#39;s illustrations for both give one a sense of Lewis Carroll&#39;s original intent and design. The University of Adelaide&#39;s eBooks@Adelaide site makes available both Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glasswith Tenniel&#39;s illustrations placed approximately where they were in the original text, although the chapters themselves are not broken into pages. Thus that online edition, for many people, is a reasonable although not exact substitute for the printed book. For those who choose to use online editions in this course, links for the currently available ones that I would suggest are listed below. 

Grimm — Children&#39;s and Household Tales (Lucy Crane translation with Walter Crane illustrations)
Carroll — Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass
Stoker — Dracula (This reading is somewhat longer than most of the others. You may want to begin it in advance.)
Shelley — Frankenstein
Hawthorne &amp; Poe — Stories and Poems (Hawthorne&#39;s Mosses from an Old Manse includes &quot;The Birthmark,&quot; &quot;Rappaccini&#39;s Daughter,&quot; and &quot;The Artist of the Beautiful&quot; and his Twice-Told Tales includes &quot;Dr. Heidegger&#39;s Experiment&quot;; The Portable Poe includes all the suggested Poe stories and poems
Wells — The Island of Dr. Moreau, The Invisible Man, &quot;The Country of the Blind,&quot; &quot;The Star&quot;
Burroughs &amp; Gilman — A Princess of Mars &amp; Herland
Bradbury — The Martian Chronicles (not available for legal, free download)
LeGuin — The Left Hand of Darkness (not available for legal, free download)
Doctorow — Little Brother (This reading is somewhat longer than most of the others. You may want to begin it in advance.)
In whatever form, I hope you enjoy your reading! 

Reading Advice
Should you read the works for this course as they come up each week or in advance? Different people work best different ways. I like to read slowly, underline, write in the margins, and make up an index to a work when I&#39;ve finished reading it. For me reading in advance often works nicely because I can, just before the moment when I need to discuss the work, review the underlinings and the index to fully refresh my memory and get an overview of the work. For other people, particularly those who don&#39;t take extensive notes, reading quite close to the moment of discussion or of writing about the work is crucial. I think individuals will need to judge for themselves which way to read for this course.
Course Format
This course includes an introductory unit of video clips discussing how one should proceed plus ten content units.  Each content unit asks for the reading of a book or book-length selection of writings in the field of fantasy and science fiction and offers the chance to write a brief essay about that unit’s reading and to comment on the writing of four other participants.  Each content unit begins with a video clip with some advice about that unit’s reading and later provides a series of clips, totaling about 1 1/2 hours, discussing both the unit’s reading and general matters that that reading helps explore.  The course also offers an enrichment quiz (ungraded) for each unit and an on-going forum for participant discussion.  That forum will be monitored and may stimulate the creation of a supplementary clip or two per unit.  If any participant desires a grade, the grade will be determined by the quality and quantity of the writing and responses to the writing of others.
FAQ
Will I get a certificate after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a certificate signed by the instructor.

What resources will I need for this class?
For this course, all you need is an Internet connection, copies of the texts (most of which can be obtained for free), and the time to read, write, discuss, and enjoy some marvelous literature.

What is the coolest thing I&#39;ll learn if I take this class?
In addition to dealing with some terrific fiction, this course aims to help everyone think more imaginatively, read more deeply, and write more powerfully.</field>

In the follow-up to this course (FE &amp; RM Part II) we will consider portfolio optimization, risk management and more advanced examples of derivatives pricing including, for example, real options and energy derivatives.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Financial Engineering is a multidisciplinary field involving finance and economics, mathematics, statistics, engineering and computational methods.  The emphasis of FE &amp; RM Part I will be on the use of simple stochastic models to price derivative securities in various asset classes including equities, fixed income, credit and mortgage-backed securities. We will also consider the role that some of these asset classes played during the financial crisis. A notable feature of this course will be an interview module with Emanuel Derman, the renowned ``quant&#39;&#39; and best-selling author of &quot;My Life as a Quant&quot;.  

We hope that students who complete the course and the follow-up course (FE &amp; RM Part II) will have a good understanding of the &quot;rocket science&quot; behind financial engineering.

In this course we will explore the intersection of statistics and functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, which is a non-invasive technique for studying brain activity. We will discuss the analysis of fMRI data, from its acquisition to its use in locating brain activity, making inference about brain connectivity and predictions about psychological or disease states. A standard fMRI study gives rise to massive amounts of noisy data with a complicated spatio-temporal correlation structure. Statistics plays a crucial role in understanding the nature of the data and obtaining relevant results that can be used and interpreted by neuroscientists.

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
A food system encompasses the activities, people and resources involved in getting food from field to plate. Along the way, it intersects with aspects of public health, equity and the environment.  In this course, we will provide a brief introduction to the U.S. food system and how food production practices and what we choose to eat impacts the world in which we live. Through several case studies, we will discuss some key historical and political factors that have helped shape the current food system and consider alternative approaches from farm to fork. The course will be led by a team of faculty and staff from the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future.  Guest lecturers will include experts from a variety of disciplines, including public health and agriculture.
Recommended Background
An understanding of public health or nutrition is helpful but not necessary. As farmer and poet Wendell Berry noted, “Eating is an agricultural act.”

The French Revolution was one of the most important upheavals in world history. This course examines its origins, course and outcomes.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
The French Revolution is one of the great turning-points in history.

In 1789 huge numbers of French peasants, urban workers and middle-class people successfully rebelled against absolute monarchy and the privileges of the nobility. But the struggle over what social and political system should replace the &#39;Old Regime&#39; was to divide French people and finally the whole of Europe. This subject examines the history of the French Revolution from its origins to 1799.

The French Revolution continues to fascinate us, to inspire us, at times to horrify us. Never before had the people of a large and populous country sought to remake their society on the basis of the principles of liberty and equality. The drama, success and tragedy of their project has attracted students to it for more than two centuries. Its importance and fascination for us are undiminished as we try to understand revolutions in our own times.
Course Syllabus
The subject will cover the following major topics:
The old regime in France: society, economy, politics.
The Revolution of 1789: causes and narrative.
The Revolutionary remaking of France, 1789-92: Church and State.
The Revolution in crisis, 1792-93: republic and military invasion.
Ending the Terror of 1793-94 and ending the Revolution.
Change and continuity: How revolutionary was the revolution?

A course driven by 20 practical questions about wireless, web, and the Internet, about how products from companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon, Ericsson, HP, Skype and AT&amp;T work. In this offering, we will cover 7 of the 20 questions, and you will have the opportunity to personalize your own learning experience by choosing which of the versions suits you best.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
You pick up your iPhone while waiting in line at a coffee shop. You google a not-so-famous actor, get linked to a Wikipedia entry listing his recent movies and popular YouTube clips of several of them. You check out user reviews on Amazon and pick one, download that movie on BitTorrent or stream that in Netflix. But suddenly the WiFi logo on your phone is gone and you&#39;re on 3G. Video quality starts to degrade, but you don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the server getting crowded or the Internet is congested somewhere. In any case, it costs you $10 per Gigabyte, and you decide to stop watching the movie, and instead multitask between sending tweets and calling your friend on Skype, while songs stream from iCloud to your phone. You&#39;re happy with the call quality, but get a little irritated when you see there&#39;re no new followers on Twitter. You may wonder how they all kind of work, and why sometimes they don&#39;t. Take a look at the list of 20 questions below. Each question is selected not just for its relevance to our daily lives, but also for the core concepts in the field of networking illustrated by its answers. This course is about formulating and answering some of these 20 questions.

	<field name="course_intro">Beginning Game Programming with C#
Start learning how to program video games using the C# programming language. Plenty of practice opportunities are included!</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
The Beginning Game Programming with C# course is all about learning how to develop video games using the C# programming language. Why use C# instead of C++, Java, ActionScript, or some other programming language you may have heard of? First, using C# lets us use the Microsoft XNA and open-source MonoGame frameworks, which help us quickly develop games for Windows, Android, iOS, Mac OS, and others. Second, the Unity game engine is very popular with indie game developers, and C# is one of the programming languages you can use in the Unity environment. And finally, C# is a really good language for learning how to program.

That learning how to program comment is important because this course doesn&#39;t assume you have any previous programming experience. Don&#39;t worry if you&#39;ve never written code before; we&#39;ll start at the very beginning and work our way up to building a small, complete game by the end of the course. Throughout the course you&#39;ll learn core programming concepts that apply to lots of programming languages, including C#, and you&#39;ll also learn how to apply those concepts when you develop games: drawing all the entities in the game world, updating the game world based on user input and simple physics, playing music and sound effects in your games, and so on.

Computer programming is really fun in general, and programming games is even better!

Course Syllabus
Week One: Introduction to the course, the Visual Studio environment, and the Microsoft XNA framework. Writing your first C# program and starting to learn about data types.

Week Two: Classes and objects, the core of object-oriented programming (which works great for games!). Writing your first XNA programs.

Week Three: Strings and what we can do with them. Selection, how to implement it, and why it&#39;s so useful in game development.

Week Four: Mouse and 360 controller input in XNA. Arrays and collection classes to store multiple pieces of information.

Week Five: Iteration - the various ways we can do multiple things in our code.

Week Six: Class design and implementation in more detail. How are all those useful classes we&#39;ve been using actually coded?

Week Seven: Adding music and sound effects to your games. Keyboard input and text output in XNA.

Week Eight: The optional project as a great way to review for the Final Exam.
Recommended Background
No previous programming experience required; all are welcome!
Suggested Readings
I strongly recommend (but don&#39;t require) that you purchase Beginning C# Programming with XNA Game Studio by A.T. Chamillard (that&#39;s me). It&#39;s available as an ebook from Kobo, Barnes and Noble, and Amazon (free eReaders are readily available for the PC and Mac).

The book covers the course material in much more depth than the lectures can and it can serve as a very useful reference as you complete the programming assignments and the project. You can, however, make it through the course without the book by spending more time referencing free online resources, so it&#39;s up to you to make a cost/time tradeoff decision based on your personal situation.

Course Format
The class will consist of lecture videos that will generally be less than 15 minutes long. Most lecture videos will contain numerous integrated quiz questions. The required assignments include 6 programming assignments and a small game project you&#39;ll develop in 5 increments. There&#39;s also a final exam for the course.

Optional activities include numerous small programming labs throughout the course and another small game project in the final week of the course to solidify the course concepts and help you prepare for the final exam. In addition, there&#39;s also an optional game you can play on your computer to help motivate you to do the course work.
FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class? 
Students earning a 70% or above will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor. 

What resources will I need for this class? 
For this course, you&#39;ll need to install the free Microsoft Visual C# 2010 Express environment and the free Microsoft XNA Game Studio 4.0 Refresh framework. Although the ebook is strongly recommended, you can complete the course without it by spending extra time using online resources. And, of course, you&#39;ll need time, motivation, and brain power! 

Can I use a Mac or Linux for the class? 
The default development environment for the programming in the course -- Visual C# 2010 Express and XNA Game Studio 4.0 Refresh -- is definitely for Windows, so if you can boot into Windows you should use the default environment. If not, though, Mac and Linux users can use MonoDevelop and MonoGame to do all the course work. I provide all the course materials for Windows users, Mac users, and Linux users.

What if I Can&#39;t Install XNA with Windows 8? 
Some people have run into compatibility issues when trying to install XNA on a Windows 8 machine. If you  run into that problem, check out the steps here. One of my Coursera students also discovered this link -- http://www.xbox.com/en-US/LIVE/PC/DownloadClient -- which I haven&#39;t tried, but it is another option.

What&#39;s the coolest thing I&#39;ll learn if I take this class? 
Contrary to pop culture stereotypes, programming is pretty cool on its own. Even better, though, you&#39;ll be learning to program games!</field>

Preview Lectures</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Popularized by movies such as &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;, game theory is the mathematical modeling of strategic interaction among rational (and irrational) agents. Beyond what we call &#39;games&#39; in common language, such as chess, poker, soccer, etc., it includes the modeling of conflict among nations, political campaigns, competition among firms, and trading behavior in markets such as the NYSE. How could you begin to model eBay, Google keyword auctions, and peer to peer file-sharing networks, without accounting for the incentives of the people using them? The course will provide the basics: representing games and strategies, the extensive form (which computer scientists call game trees), Bayesian games (modeling things like auctions), repeated and stochastic games, and more. We&#39;ll include a variety of examples including classic games and real-world applications.
Course Syllabus
Week 1. Introduction:  Introduction, overview, uses of game theory, some applications and examples, and formal definitions of: the normal form, payoffs, strategies, pure strategy Nash equilibrium, dominated strategies.

Week 2. Mixed-strategy Nash equilibria: Definitions, examples, real-world evidence.

Week 3. Alternate solution concepts: iterative removal of strictly dominated strategies, minimax strategies and the minimax theorem for zero-sum game, correlated equilibria.

Week 4. Extensive-form games: Perfect information games: trees, players assigned to nodes, payoffs, backward Induction, subgame perfect equilibrium, introduction to imperfect-information games, mixed versus behavioral strategies.

Week 5. Repeated games: Repeated prisoners dilemma, finite and infinite repeated games, limited-average versus future-discounted reward, folk theorems, stochastic games and learning.

Week 6. Coalitional games: Transferable utility cooperative games, Shapley value, Core, applications.

Week 7. Bayesian games: General definitions, ex ante/interim Bayesian Nash equilibrium.

Recommended Background
You must be comfortable with mathematical thinking and rigorous arguments. Relatively little specific math is required; the course involves lightweight probability theory (for example, you should know what a conditional probability is) and very lightweight calculus (for instance, taking a derivative).

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Popularized by movies such as &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;, game theory is the mathematical modeling of strategic interaction among rational (and irrational) agents.  Over four weeks of lectures, this advanced course considers how to design interactions between agents in order to achieve good social outcomes. Three main topics are covered:  social choice theory (i.e., collective decision making), mechanism design, and auctions.

In the first week we consider the problem of aggregating different agents&#39; preferences, discussing voting rules and the challenges faced in collective decision making. We present some of the most important theoretical results in the area: notably, Arrow&#39;s Theorem, which proves that there is no &quot;perfect&quot; voting system, and also the Gibbard-Satterthwaite and Muller-Satterthwaite Theorems.  We move on to consider the problem of making collective decisions when agents are self interested and can strategically misreport their preferences. We explain &quot;mechanism design&quot; -- a broad framework for designing interactions between self-interested agents -- and give some key theoretical results. Our third week focuses on the problem of designing mechanisms to maximize aggregate happiness across agents, and presents the powerful family of Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanisms.  The course wraps up with a fourth week that considers the problem of allocating scarce resources among self-interested agents, and that provides an introduction to auction theory. 
Course Syllabus
There will be four weeks of materials consisting of online videos and problem sets. We recommend that you complete the problem set for each week within that week, although the hard deadline is two weeks from the release date. On the fifth week, we will have a final exam.

Week 1. Social Choice

Week 2. Mechanism Design

Week 3. Efficient Mechanisms

Week 4. Auctions

Week 5-6. Final exam and final problem set.

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Gamification is the application of digital game design techniques to non-game problems, such as business and social impact challenges. Video games are the dominant entertainment form of our time because they are powerful tools for motivating behavior. Effective games leverage both psychology and technology, in ways that can be applied outside the immersive environments of games themselves. Gamification as a business practice has exploded over the past two years. Organizations are applying it in areas such as marketing, human resources, productivity enhancement, sustainability, training, health and wellness, innovation, and customer engagement. Game thinking means more than just dropping in badges and leaderboards; it requires a thoughtful understanding of motivation and design techniques. This course examines the mechanisms of gamification and provides an understanding of its effective use.

Recommended Background
Kevin Werbach &amp; Dan Hunter, For the Win: How Game Thinking Can Revolutionize Your Business (Wharton Digital Press, 2012).

This course is designed as an introduction to gamification as a business practice. No particular technical knowledge or prior coursework are required.
Suggested Readings
The course is designed to be self-contained. For those seeking additional background material, the version of the syllabus on the course website will link to suggested resources keyed to the course units.  Professor Werbach’s book, For the Win, which goes into greater detail on the topics of the course, was published in November 2012 by Wharton Digital Press. It is available in ebook and paperback formats worldwide.  
Course Format
The class will consist of video lectures, which are between 7 and 12 minutes in length. Many of them contain integrated quiz questions. 1-2 units of lectures will be posted each week; you can watch them any time after that.  There are also standalone multiple-choice homework assignments for most weeks of the course (5-10 questions per week), and three short peer-graded written assignments involving realistic gamification scenarios.  The course ends with a multiple-choice final exam.
FAQ
• Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing the course? 

Yes. Students who successfully complete the course above a threshold score will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor. 

• Who should take this course? 

Anyone curious about gamification or games more generally. That might include: students in business, IT, design, engineering, games studies, or other related fields; employees at companies that could apply gamification to their business; technologists or entrepreneurs seeking to incorporate gamification into their projects; game designers wondering about business or social impact applications; investors wondering about the financial potential of the games industry; educators interested in gamification for learning; video game aficionados excited about the deeper potential of games; or anyone seeking to deepen their understanding of an exciting new field. 

• What resources will I need? 

Nothing, other than the ability to access the Coursera website and other sites on Internet. The lecture videos, homeworks, and exam will sometimes direct you to investigate a website or view a video for further information. You might even be asked to play a game or two. 

If you want additional support material for the course, I encourage you to purchase my book, For the Win, which many students find to be a useful companion text.

• What does a typical class session look like? 

In most of the lecture segments, I’ll describe gamification concepts and illustrate them with examples, screenshots, and diagrams. I’ll often use real-world case-studies as illustrations. In a few of the segments, I will interview leading gamification experts, executives, and investors. 

• Is the course gamified? 

No, not in the sense of having points and badges associated with course activities. Given the novelty of the course and the massive open online format, I didn’t feel I could implement a gamified system that was technically feasible and supportive of the learning experience in the available timeframe. Gamification isn’t a solution for everything, and it’s not always easy to do well! That being said, in the course I’ll discuss examples of educators using gamification in effective ways. And there just might be a game-like aspect or two of the lectures. 

• What will I learn from this course? 

That’s largely up to you! The course provides a solid introduction to the concepts and practices of gamification, which can be applied in a number of ways. You’ll be able to think about applying gamification to your business or your life, and to connect gamification with other fields such as marketing, strategy, IT, psychology, and design. And hopefully you’ll see video games in a whole new light. 

• Is this course different than the prior sessions Gamification on Coursera? 

This is another session of the same course.  It has been revised to correct errors and update information, and restructured to allow more time for completing assignments, but it covers the same material as the 2012 and 2013 sessions.

This introduction to fundamental chemical concepts of atomic and molecular structure will emphasize the development of these concepts from experimental observations and scientific reasoning.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This course will cover an introduction to the atomic molecular structure of matter, similar to a typical first semester General Chemistry course.  The fundamental concepts will be introduced via the Concept Development Approach developed at Rice University and utilizing a free on-line textbook, Concept Development Studies in Chemistry, available via Rice’s Connexions project.  In this approach, rather than simply telling you the concepts you need to know and then asking you to memorize them or apply them, we will develop these concepts from experimental observations and scientific reasoning.  There are several reasons for using this approach.  One reason is that most of us our inductive learners, meaning that we like to make specific observations and then generalize from there.  Many of the most significant concepts in Chemistry are counter-intuitive.  When we see where those concepts come from, we can more readily accept them, explain them, and apply them. A second reason is that scientific reasoning in general and Chemistry reasoning in particular are inductive processes.  This Concept Development approach illustrates those reasoning processes.  A third reason is that this is simply more interesting.  The structure and reactions of matter are fascinating puzzles to be solved by observation and reasoning.  It is more fun intellectually when we can solve those puzzles together, rather than simply have the answers to the riddles revealed at the outset.

This course is the second semester of the two semester sequence, Chemistry Concept Development and Application. This course will cover the topics of a typical second semester General Chemistry course at most colleges and universities. We will use the Chemistry Concept Development Study approach, developed and used in our courses at Rice and used in Part I of this course.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This course will cover the second half of an introduction to General Chemistry, including properties of matter, phase transition and equilibrium, solution equilibrium, reaction rates and kinetics, reaction equilibrium, acid-base equilibrium and thermodynamics.  We will use a free on-line textbook, Concept Development Studies in Chemistry, available via Rice’s Connexions project. 

The fundamental concepts in the course will be introduced via the Concept Development Approach developed at Rice University.  In this approach, we will develop the concepts you need to know from experimental observations and scientific reasoning rather than simply telling you the concepts and then asking you to simply memorize or apply them.

So why use this approach? 

One reason is that most of us are inductive learners, meaning that we like to make specific observations and then generalize from there.  Many of the most significant concepts in Chemistry are counter-intuitive.  When we see where those concepts come from, we can more readily accept them, explain them, and apply them. 

A second reason is that scientific reasoning in general and Chemistry reasoning in particular are inductive processes.  This Concept Development approach illustrates those reasoning processes.  

A third reason is that this is simply more interesting! The structure and reactions of matter are fascinating puzzles to be solved by observation and reasoning.  It is more fun intellectually when we can solve those puzzles together, rather than simply have the answers to the riddles revealed at the outset.

To acquire an understanding of the fundamental concepts of genomics and biotechnology, and their implications for human biology, evolution, medicine, social policy and individual life path choices in the 21st century.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
In this class we will cover the essentials of genomics to help you better understand your own life (know thy genome, know thyself), and how advances in biotechnology are radically changing the scientific landscape.

We will begin with some of the most basic issues of genetics, such as the composition of genomes and how the information in them is processed so we can get an adult human from an egg. Then we’ll see that much of the power of genomics is in comparisons. If I only had your genome there&#39;s not much I could do with it. But if I lined it up against a chimpanzee genome I’d see that they are 98.5% identical. It’s that 1.5% difference that we study to determine what makes a chimp a chimp and a human a human. 

In the next few years you’ll be able to get your genome done for a few hundred dollars, and we will look at the challenges you might face dealing with this new self-knowledge. We shall particularly focus on behavior. How can genes predispose some of us to be nice and others of us to be psychopaths? We will be examining behavior as a complex unfolding of interactions between your genome and the environment.

Thanks in large part to genomics we are beginning to understand the living processes that constitute ourselves, where we can begin to intervene to take control of our own future. We will look at the technologies involved and the consequences of this new power. Genetic engineering has already changed what you eat and the medicines you take, and will likely therefore change how long you live. If we choose to genetically engineer ourselves as some advocate then we may also change how we view ourselves as human beings. We do not know where our ability to intervene in our own living processes is going to lead us. Depending on your point of view that is the promise or the threat of the era we live in. Scientists today already envisage creating life from scratch, and we are entering a world where political considerations, and imagination, may be the only brakes on biotechnology.
Course Syllabus
Lectures

Week 1. An Introduction to Genetics and Learning the Lingo  

Week 2. A History Lesson-Comparative Genomics, know thy ancestors  

Week 3. My Genes Made Me Do It, An examination of the role of genes in behavior, and midterm exam (from weeks 1-3 material)

Week 4. My Genes Didn’t Make Me Do It. Beyond The Genes, Nature via Nurture, and Epigenetics  

Week 5. An Introduction to Genetic Engineering and Learning the Lingo

Learning Outcomes

Students will be able to describe/demonstrate:

I. A conceptual and holistic understanding of genetics that includes the major questions arising at the intersection of genetics, genomics and society. The course will stress human genetics.

II. An understanding of terms, concepts, and approaches used in studying genetics and genomics. As a case study, the course will examine behavioral genetics: James Watson likes to say “the 20th century saw the fusion of genetics and biochemistry, so the 21st century will see the fusion of genetics and psychology.”

III. An understanding of the power of comparative genomics. In this aspect, the course will focus particularly on human evolution as illuminated by the genomes of chimpanzees and several extinct human kinds including the Neanderthals.

IV. An understanding of the scientific, political, legal, social, economic and ethical issues raised by genomics and the application of biotechnology to “transhumanism.”

Recommended Background
All are welcome to join us in this adventure. Some previous exposure to biology will enrich your experience with this course.

Suggested Readings
Although the lectures are designed to be self-contained, we will be recommending additional readings throughout the course for those who wish to delve further into particular topics. All additional readings are open source materials which can be found through the web. You do not need to purchase anything.
Course Format
The class consists of  five to seven 10-15 minute talks per week. The videos contain integrated quiz questions. A midterm examination will be available as will a final examination. These exams will consist of multiple choice questions.

A whirlwind introduction to evolution and genetics, from basic principles to current applications, including how disease genes are mapped and how we leverage evolutionary concepts to aid humanity.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Introduction to Genetics and Evolution is a college-level class being offered simultaneously to new students at Duke University. The course gives interested people a very basic overview of some principles behind these very fundamental areas of biology.  We often hear about new &quot;genome sequences,&quot; commercial kits that can tell you about your ancestry (including pre-human) from your DNA or disease predispositions, debates about the truth of evolution, why animals behave the way they do, and how people found &quot;genetic evidence for natural selection.&quot;  This course provides the basic biology you need to understand all of these issues better, tries to clarify some misconceptions, and tries to prepare students for future, more advanced coursework in Biology.  No prior coursework is assumed.

Course Syllabus
Evidence for evolution
Introduction to basic genetics
Recombination and genetic mapping simple traits
Complications to genetic mapping
Genes vs. environment
Basic population genetics and Hardy-Weinberg
Gene flow, differentiation, inbreeding
Natural selection and genetic drift
Molecular evolution
Adaptive behaviors and sexual selection
Species formation and phylogenetics
Evolutionary applications and misapplications

Recommended Background
No prior coursework in the subject is assumed. It would be helpful for the application of some concepts to have a working knowledge of High School level math, including basic algebra. While useful for solving the assigned problems, this is not essential to understand and follow the general concepts and otherwise enjoy the class.
Suggested Readings
Although the class is largely self-contained, students wanting reinforcement on some of the lecture topics and/ or to expand their knowledge beyond what we cover in class can find a compelling treatment of the evidence for evolution (as well as related topics) in this short book: 
Coyne, Jerry. 2009. Why Evolution Is True  

For assistance with the genetics and more in-depth evolutionary concepts, these textbooks may be helpful as a supplements to the lectures: 
Griffiths, Anthony, et al. 2010. Introduction to Genetic Analysis  
Freeman, Scott, and John Herron. Evolutionary Analysis

Various alternative freely available readings will be specified in the course as well. 

Finally, if you have an iOS device (e.g., iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch), we recommend this free app, specifically designed to be a supplement to the course and written in part by a former Coursera student in the course: 
Genetics and Evolution app 
Use of this app is NOT required, however-- it&#39;s simply a supplemental tool that can help by allowing you to simulate concepts, test yourself on terms, generate practice problems, and solve some kinds of problems used in the course. 
Course Format
The class will consist of watching multiple lecture mini-videos which are mostly 10-20 minutes in length.  These sometimes contain 1-3 integrated quiz questions per video.  There will also be 2 test assessments, including a non-cumulative final exam.
FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.

What background in biology is needed for this course?
The course does not assume any college-level background in biology. A few introductory genetics topics are covered somewhat quickly, such that those who did not learn basic heredity in grade-school may struggle with the pace, but students who had literally no biology have succeeded in understanding the material from just this treatment and a little bit of internet searching.

What if I don&#39;t believe in evolution? What if it conflicts with my faith?
The course presents evidence for evolution in the first lecture, and delves into extensive detail on evolutionary processes later. Enrolled parties need not in any way modify or abandon their belief system, but test questions will be based on the material as it is covered in the lectures.

Will the lectures cover macroevolution, or talk about the diversity of past (e.g., dinosaurs) or present life?
The present version does not cover macroevolution or the diversity of life. There will not be anything about dinosaurs. The evolution topics covered in the present course are largely confined to &quot;microevolution,&quot; though we hope to add some new topics spanning macroevolution to future course iterations.

Will the lectures cover any molecular biology, or applications like PCR or next-generation DNA sequencing?
No. The genetics lectures are limited to basic transmission genetics, recombination, genetic mapping, and basic quantitative genetics. Please see other courses for these topics.

Will the lectures discuss human cloning or the use of embryonic or pluripotent stem cells?
No.

I&#39;ve taken past iterations of this course-- has it changed?
There are a few new videos and a few other edits since the 1st &amp; 2nd iterations.

Does Prof. Mohamed Noor ALWAYS talk that fast?
Yes.</field>

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Each of our cells contains nearly identical copies of our genome, which provides instructions that allow us to develop and function. The field of Genomics focuses on the structure and function of genomes and plays a major and increasing role in both medicine and research. This course serves as an introduction to the main laboratory and theoretical aspects of genomics and is divided into themes: genomes, genetics, functional genomics, systems biology, single cell approaches, proteomics, and applications. We start with the basics, DNA sequencing and the genome project, then move to high throughput sequencing methods and applications. Next we introduce principles of genetics and then apply them in clinical genetics and other large-scale sequencing projects. In the functional genomics unit, we start with RNA expression dynamics, analysis of alternative splicing, epigenomics and ChIP-seq, and metagenomics. Model organisms and forward and reverse genetics screens are then discussed, along with quantitative trait locus (QTL) and eQTL analysis. After that, we introduce integrative and single cell genomics approaches and systems biology. Finally, we conclude by introducing in applying proteomic approaches.


Course Format
The class will consist of lecture videos, which are between 45 and 60 minutes in length.  Each lecture contains several integrated quiz questions.  There will be assigned readings, written assignments based on those readings, and three exams.

Precision medicine has the potential to change fundamentally how health care is practiced, but requires a health care workforce that understands the complexities of this field. One important component of Precision Medicine is the use of an individual’s genomic information to offer targeted treatment, tailored to the individual. Our course aims to provide participants with some baseline knowledge of genomics, an overview of the clinical applications of genomic medicine, the skills to evaluate the clinical validity and utility of new tests, and an appreciation of the associated ethical and social issues inherent in this field. 

The course is geared toward practicing health care providers, although it should be accessible to anyone with a background in the biological sciences and a basic understanding of genetics.  It is designed to be succinct and clinically-focused, offering both conceptual and practical information about real-world applications of genomics.  Lessons 1 and 4 offer a basic primer on molecular genomics relevant to the individual patient as well as to patient populations. The remaining five lessons focus on five applications of genomics and present the material as case studies, highlighting the strengths, limitations, and issues that arise in the use of each test.

Think that a prescription medication must be safer than a “street drug”? Think again. Investigate the epidemic rise of prescription drug abuse and use science to debunk commonly held misconceptions regarding this phenomenon.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
We are Generation Rx. 

As a society, we have become more and more “pharmaceuticalized”. We expect a quick fix for almost any medical problem. We refer to ample amounts of medical information (or mis-information) online, sometimes without the guidance of a health professional. We are taking prescription and over-the-counter medications at unprecedented rates, and there are benefits to this phenomenon, including in many cases, improved disease treatment. Sadly, a darker consequence has also emerged: the epidemic rise of injuries and fatalities due to prescription drug abuse. 

This course uses science to investigate the prevalence, dangers, and misperceptions regarding this growing health problem. Using a myth-busting design, we will investigate the biology behind both therapeutic and illicit drug action and tie that biology to the real dangers of abusing prescription drugs. Additionally, we will explore societal influences on drug-taking behaviors and identify best medication-taking practices for our benefit as well as others’.
Course Syllabus
Module One: What is Generation Rx?
Module Two: Myth - Everyone else is doing it, so why shouldn&#39;t I?
Module Three: Myth - Prescription drugs must be safer than street drugs.
Module Four: Myth - It is only a problem if I&#39;m trying to get high.
Module Five: Myth - Prescription drugs cannot be addictive.
Module Six: Where to go from here...
Recommended Background
None. However, we will investigate the basic science of drug action, and therefore a high school level-understanding of biology is recommended.

Learn about General Game Playing (GGP) and develop GGP programs capable of competing against humans and other programs in GGP competitions .</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
General game players are computer systems able to play strategy games based solely on formal game descriptions supplied at &quot;runtime&quot;.  (In other words, they don&#39;t know the rules until the game starts.)  Unlike specialized game players, such as Deep Blue, general game players cannot rely on algorithms designed in advance for specific games; they must discover such algorithms themselves.  General game playing expertise depends on intelligence on the part of the game player and not just intelligence of the programmer of the game player. 

GGP is an interesting application in its own right.  It is intellectually engaging and more than a little fun.  But it is much more than that.  It provides a theoretical framework for modeling discrete dynamic systems and for defining rationality in a way that takes into account problem representation and complexities like incompleteness of information and resource bounds.  It has practical applications in areas where these features are important, e.g. in business and law.  More fundamentally, it raises questions about the nature of intelligence and serves as a laboratory in which to evaluate competing approaches to artificial intelligence.

This course is an introduction to General Game Playing (GGP).  Students will get an introduction to the theory of General Game Playing and will learn how to create GGP programs capable of competing against other programs and humans.
Recommended Background
Students should be familiar with Symbolic Logic and should be able to read and understand program fragments written in a modern programming language.  This background is sufficient for understanding the presentation and for configuring players to compete in competitions (using software components provided by the instructors).  Students who wish to modify the standard components or who wish to build their own players also need the ability to develop programs on their own.  This latter ability is desirable but not required.</field>

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This course provides an introduction to the business of primary energy production.  We will examine the nature of demand and supply in global energy markets, and business considerations for participants in those markets.  Students taking this course will be able to identify the distinctive challenges facing enterprises engaged in development of primary energy resources.  The course is intended to provide a broad perspective of the challenges for businesses and policy authorities engaged in diverse but integrated global energy markets.
Course Syllabus
Week 1 –  Energy defined and an overview of demand: Energy is the capacity to do work.  In this most essential sense, energy is a basic human need.  We will consider how technological innovations have increased the ability of mankind to do work but only by increasing our demand for various sources of energy.  We will examine the determinants of demand for energy as well as the distribution of demand around the globe.

Week 2 – Energy supplies and market allocations:  A broad range of primary sources are used to satisfy our need for energy.  Accessing these sources depends on many factors, including available technologies and skills, and a number of political factors.  We will address these factors as well as issues and trends in energy supply.

Week 3 – Key capabilities for energy business:  In this week, we will more closely examine the various sources of fossil fuel energy such as coal, oil, gas as well as discuss the key business processes that affect their accessibility and use. 

Week 4-  Key capabilities for energy business:  In this week, we will more closely examine the various sources of alternative energy such as nuclear and renewable energy as well as discuss the key business processes that affect their accessibility and use.

Week 5 – Key stakeholders in energy business:  Energy enterprises engage in complex activities with far-reaching consequences.  Consequently, these activities often motivate to action a diverse set of stakeholders.  We will examine the systemic nature of energy businesses and how it inevitably leads to engagement in political spheres.

Week 6 – Strategic considerations in energy business:  In the concluding week of the course, we will consider the strategic implications of the economic, commercial, and political environment of energy.

You will gain insight into how challenges have changed over time, we will discuss the likely determinants of such changes and examine future projections. Successful international strategies and programs promoting human health will be highlighted and global health governance structures will be mapped and the role of the key actors explored.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
The course takes its starting point in the belief that good health is intimately linked with personal happiness, productivity, the economic and social development of nations and the advancement of people. 

Globalization processes influence the health of individuals, societies and the function of health systems in many ways and may present opportunities but may also pose a risk to vulnerable societies. Throughout this course presentations will transcend the perspectives of individual countries and will critically discuss how global mega-trends and different sectors of society influence the health of population. Transition in health and the drivers of such transition will be core elements of this course.  

During the six course weeks we will explore a range of themes, including: communicable and non-communicable diseases, environmental health, child health, reproductive health and rights, and health among refugees and displaced populations. We focus on the dual burden of communicable and non-communicable disease experienced by much of the world’s population today.

As the deadline for meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDG’s) nears, course participants will also reflect on the post-MDG agenda by exploring the future of global health and trends in technical innovation, global strategies and programs in the fight for better health. Through lectures, readings, and assignments, course participants will be asked to think critically about the health of the world’s population and to reflect on overcoming the challenges of achieving good health around the world.

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Course coordinators: Prof. Antoine Geissbuhler, MD, Prof. Louis Loutan, MD, Dr Slim Slama, MD and Dr Didier Wernli, MD, MA

Course assistant: Dr Rafael Ruiz de Castaneda, PhD 

Our globalised world has posed new challenges for global health. Infectious diseases have the potential to travel quickly and spread widely across countries (e.g. due to increased international travel). The determinants of health (such as the food system) are across country borders, leading to a growing burden in non-communicable diseases in both developed and developing countries. Issues in traditionally non health sectors such as climate change or trade can have dramatic and worldwide effects on health and health systems. 

These short examples illustrate what Global Health is about:  issues that not only cross national boundaries but also disciplinary territories. In our interdependent world, more and more health issues cannot be addressed by a country nor by a sector alone and require collaboration, coordination and integration. 

The course will draw from academic personnel working across disciplines and the wider community in international Geneva (e.g. international organisations, NGOs). It will utilise an ecological or &#39;systems&#39; perspective, along with a social determinants and human rights approach to health.

	<field name="course_intro">Globalizing Higher Education and Research for the ‘Knowledge Economy’
This course is designed to examine an array of issues related to the globalization of higher education and research. The main objective of the course is to enable students to better understand how and why universities are engaged in the globalization process, as well as what the key implications of this development process are.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Universities and higher education systems worldwide are being transformed by new and changing actors, practices, programs, policies, and agendas. From notions of &#39;global competency&#39; and &#39;international branch campuses,&#39; to ever more common perceptions that international collaborative research is a desirable objective, through to the phenomena of bibliometrics, rankings and benchmarking that are framed and operate at a global scale, contexts are changing. This massive open online course (MOOC) itself, developed in Madison and Bristol and hosted on the Coursera platform in Silicon Valley, is a perfect case in point!

Globalizing Higher Education and Research for the ‘Knowledge Economy’ is designed to help students better understand some of these complex changes. Our specific objectives are to:

Provide an integrated &#39;big picture&#39; regarding the globalization of higher education and research.  
Reinforce the value of thinking about processes of change by focusing on emergences -- the forward edges of change -- as well as the frictions associated with these processes. We attempt to make this tangible by highlighting the role of relevant logics, thinkers, institutions, networks, technologies, ideas, temporalities, and regulations.
Highlight the role of relative and variable forms of power in shaping agendas and practices, as well as uneven development patterns and outcomes.
In the end, we hope to stimulate some exciting globally oriented learning about how the higher education sector - from research to teaching, learning, and service (the &#39;third mission&#39;) - are changing.

Recommended Background
No formal background knowledge is required; all are welcome. The key thing is to be interested in the contemporary transformation of higher education and research.
Suggested Readings
No required reading apart from what is provided in the course. We do recommend, though, that you track and follow materials posted on fully open access sites such as Inside Higher Ed and University World News, as well as material shared via the GlobalHigherEd Twitter feed.

Course Format
The design of this course is different from most Coursera-based courses in that it does not rely on video lectures and associated quizzes. Rather, the content will be rolled out weekly via a 4000-7000 word long text with integrated multimedia elements (audio interviews with experts, visualizations, photographs, select videos, and hyperlinks to documents, reports, articles, etc.). 

All seven weeks of the course are associated with dedicated discussion forum space where you can participate in (a) independent discussions on the topics of your choice, and (b) instructor-generated discussions on 2-3 designated topics. The course also is intended to function as a free and open-access resource. Therefore, all submitted material during weekly discussion exercises will be automatically associated with a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license.
FAQ
Q: Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?

A: Students who successfully complete the course requirements specified in the detailed syllabus are eligible to receive a Statement of Accomplishment. You can still participate, though, even if you don’t seek a Statement of Accomplishment.

Q: What do you mean the course also is intended to function as a free and open-access resource?

A: The course is intended to function as a free and open-access resource. Therefore, all submitted material during weekly exercises will be automatically associated with a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license, which gives others considerable freedom to share submitted ideas. Students who submit work to the course’s forums retain copyright to it, but irrevocably grant anyone permission to use, copy, modify, and adapt it commercially with attribution. As a result, the course should de facto resemble a MOOR (a Massive Open Online Resource) – a trading space for ideas. The goal of adopting this approach is to enable the MOOC/MOOR to facilitate the building of networks between participants, the sharing of resources, and the stimulation of new and needed debates about the course topic.</field>

	<field name="course_intro">Globalization and You
This course offers an evidence-based analysis of globalization that addresses what is happening to us personally as well as economically amidst the market-led processes of global integration.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Particular attention is paid to the ways market-led macro-economic reforms associated with globalization (such as free trade agreements and privatization initiatives) have come together with much more micro innovations in how personal behavior is organized by market forces (rethinking education as a personal investment practice, for example, or outsourcing dating to for-profit companies).  Mediating between these macro and micro scales of capitalist transformation are a wide array of other market-based mechanisms examined in the course.  From bond risk ratings to the market metrics shaping FICO scores, personalized medicine and online mapping, these market-mechanisms require close examination. Tracing their influence with an awareness of their material geographic variation and unevenness, the course offers an alternative to economistic assumptions about choice-maximizing behavior on a ‘level playing field’. It explores instead the complex uneven development dynamics of globalization in ways that allow you to see how your own personal perspectives on these dynamics are at once outcomes and enablers of economic and social change.  And, by doing so, the course aims in turn at enabling you to be a more engaged participant in the ongoing debates over the direction these dynamics should take.  Key words that are debated, defined and/or explained in the course include: globalization, interdependency, discourse, capitalism, neoliberalism, value, financialization, harmonization, competition, governance, governmentality, power, citizenship, choice, accountability, enclaving, geopolitics, biopolitics, biocapital and global health.

Course Syllabus
Course goal: 
To enable you to comprehend market-led globalization in ways that allow you to evaluate how your own life and personal choices are shaped by market forces and associated global ties. 
Course-level learning objectives: 
At the end of this class you will be able to:

Describe the main debates and controversies surrounding globalization;
Analyze the ties and tensions of uneven global development;
Understand the growing impact of global market integration;
Synthesize knowledge of market globalization with your own experiences of market forces and market reforms;
Evaluate the way in which market forces define and delimit personal choices and everyday life globally;
Develop capacity to respond and reflect personally amidst the ties and tensions of market-led globalization. 
Assignment Overview: 
Here are some of the course assignments and activities: 

Video lectures: Most of the course content is delivered through video lectures. Each video runs 10-12 minutes
Discussion forums: This class thrives on discussion. Multiple discussion forums are designed to develop out of the lectures. You will have the ability to articulate your own views on globalization as well as learn from your fellow students from around the world.
Quizzes: Many video lectures have short quizzes embedded that allow you to check your grasp of basic knowledge as the course proceeds.
Peer Assessment Assignments - There are peer assessment activities available for this course.  By participating in these, and reading and responding to the work of others, you can also help improve your own learning and understanding.

Recommended Background
There are no prerequisites for this course. That said, an interest in common media depictions of globalization will help you understand the main arguments more quickly. Relatedly, reading and writing comfortably in English at the undergraduate college level will enable your more active engagement in course discussion forums and peer assessment exercises.

Part of the &quot;Challenges in Global Affairs&quot; Specialization »
This course deals with international relations, peace and security and brings together a number of experts from the field and academia to share their perspectives. The course will help you gain insight into conflict resolution and the role organizations such as the United Nations Security Council, the European Union, the African Union and NATO play in a changing world.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
How are international power relations changing and how can global peace and stability be maintained? This course familiarizes you with some main theories of international relations, shows how the global order is gradually changing and discusses how selected international and regional organizations contribute to the maintenance of global peace and security. 

You learn what research findings tell us in terms of the capacity of international organizations and actors to help prevent or stop violent conflict, what tools are used to negotiate agreements and how foundations for sustainable peace are best created. In the course, we also focus on the role of the European Union (EU) in terms of diplomacy and efforts to prevent conflict, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the contribution of organizations such as the African Union (AU) to the prevention of conflict and war. 

We also look at activities of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and, in the context of a final debate, see in which ways its membership could be adapted to more accurately reflect the power relations of the current global order. 

You learn about all of these topics by doing quizzes and exercises testing your knowledge of these subjects, helping you understand crucial concepts and get insights into how the academic study of international relations and international organization can contribute to the search for global stability and peace in practice.

This course analyzes the business side of sports and discusses the intricacies of global sports leagues as well as various countries&#39; sports strategies. You will be equipped with a framework and tools to understand and evaluate the business side of competitive sports around the world.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
The wide range of global sports businesses constitutes a multi-billion dollar industry. This course will examine and explain the business of sports by analyzing the economic, legal, governance and success models in various sports industries. The primary focus will be on American team sports but comparative global models will be contemplated as well.  We will seek to find the answers to questions such as: what lessons can global sports entities learn from each other? What business strategies are used to retain the profitability of world leagues, sports teams and franchises? What lessons can be drawn from the United States based sports models? What revised models should new entrepreneurial leagues apply in order to achieve success? Substantive instruction will be drawn from the likes of the Olympics, FIFA World Cup, MLB, NFL, Premier League, various player unions, China, India, South Africa, Brazil and much more.   Ultimately, our goal is to equip the student with a framework and tools with which to understand and evaluate the business side of a wide range of competitive sports ventures.

Course Syllabus
Module One:  Sports Leagues and Teams I: Structure and Economics

Where is the Money? We will examine the structure of sports leagues and teams including a broad overview of the legal and financial structures. The lecture will also provide an introduction to the revenue generators and revenue distribution models so that students will be able to analyze a variety of sports business enterprises. For example, we will study U.S. and European league governance including promotion and relegation. Specifically, a case study of the NFL and Manchester United sponsorships will be used to engage the students in real time developments in the sports business industry. The important role of revenues from media rights fees will be introduced and more closely examined later as a primary financial driver. Other revenue generating streams such as ticket sales and sponsorships will be highlighted as well.

Module Two: Sports Leagues and Teams II: Globalization, Leadership and Ownership

This lecture will focus on the globalization of leagues, leadership and ownership. We will begin by looking at the popularity of leagues and begin a discussion on the largest sports leagues, teams and events. We will analyze the globalization of labor markets and revenue sources with the case of the Big 4 leagues in the U.S. Beyond globalization, we will examine leadership and ownership in the sports business industry. In addition, we will focus on the role of comissioners and analyze reasons for ownership as well as integration strategies that have been developed.

Module Three: Economic Drivers I: Media rights

This week will focus on the revenue sources that flow from the playing of sports events as well as ancillary activities. This includes the traditional radio and television sources as well as the ever growing and emerging new media sources. We will begin by taking a step back to list some of the first ever live televised sporting events including the 1927 Arsenal vs Sheffield game at Highbury and the1939 baseball game between Princeton and Columbia. We will also pay special attention to the rapid growth of media rights fees and include examples such as the NBC Olympics deal. Beyond the revenues that flow from these sources we will also examine how the use of and partnering with these media outlets have evolved from an initial fear of cannibalizing the live gate to current issues about the delivery of &quot;free&quot; content and the impact on the ever-changing sports business model. This will include the increasing popularity of Regional Sports Networks.

Module Four: Economic Drivers II: Stadiums and Arenas

The focus here will be on these facilities as both revenue and economic impact generating facilities. Is there a formula used to plan for the development of sports infrastructure? We will focus on stadiums and arenas and delve into the history of the construction of great sports centers and their impact. The case of AEG as a sports facility owner will be examined as well as specific development sagas in Los Angeles and Philadelphia..

Module Five: Player Salaries, Unions and Sports Agents

The largest figures on the expense side of the sports business ledger are player salaries. This lectuure focusses on salaries as well as the key proponents of those salary increases. Sports agents and unions are key stakeholders in the sports business industry. Agents source and manage talent while unions use collective bargaining to champion for an organization of the economic system that favors salary increases. We will analyze the impact these stakeholders have had on the industry in different regions in the world and use case examples including lockouts from the past. Students will have the opportunity to compare and contrast unions around the world.

Module Six: The Olympics and The FIFA World Cup

We will take a close look at the Olympics history and economic impact. What goes into planning and executing the Olympics? We will analyze the 4-year cycle that businesspersons and athletes take to prepare for the Olympics. We will also examine ideas about the economic impact of these games on the host country’s and the world’s economy. Similarly, the FIFA World Cup, by many measures, is the world’s biggest sports event.  We will discuss the role of World Cup plays on the world’s business environment using the following lenses to analyze the tournament: fans, countries, players, media, host country, retailers and of course FIFA.

Module Seven: Sports Enterprise Global Strategies

How do sports entity leaders develop and execute global strategy? We will conclude by contrasting the different penetration levels of various sports and their presence on the global platform. We will use the framework we have developed to hypothesize the globalization of various sports and examine their financial and operational feasibility.  We’ll contemplate the elements needed for a truly global, profitable sport entity. 

Recommended Background
None; all are welcome.

The world is changing rapidly. Populations are ageing, people are moving from the countryside to the cities, there are more people suffering from obesity or who are overweight than people who go hungry, and the middle-class is growing fast in the emerging economies while it is shrinking in Europe and the United States. These forces are putting pressure on governments around the world as they seek to cope with the consequences. The race for energy, natural resources and food is intensifying, and the global financial architecture based on the U.S. dollar is seriously out of whack with the new realities of the 21st century.

Expect to learn about these and other global trends in this class. Be ready to realize how fast the world is changing, and what are the consequences for markets, businesses, and society at large.

This class describes the science of global warming and the forecast for humans’ impact on Earth’s climate. Intended for an audience without much scientific background but a healthy sense of curiosity, the class brings together insights and perspectives from physics, chemistry, biology, earth and atmospheric sciences, and even some economics—all based on a foundation of simple mathematics (algebra).</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
We start with basic principles governing Earth’s temperature. The class begins with the nature of heat and light, then builds the very simplest conceptual—and algebraic—model for the climate of a planet, including the greenhouse effect.

Over the following weeks, we introduce complexities of the real world to this model: how greenhouse gases are selective about what light they absorb, how the temperature structure and weather in the atmosphere set the stage for the greenhouse effect, and how feedbacks amplify it. From this point on the exercises will be based on on-line interactive models for various aspects of Earth’s climate and carbon cycle, exploring the topics described in the video lectures. 

We then turn to the carbon cycle of the Earth, how it stabilizes Earth’s climate on some time scales but destabilizes it on others. The fate of fossil fuel carbon will be determined by its integration into Earth’s ongoing natural carbon cycle.

The class concludes with a look at the human impact on Earth’s climate: why we believe it’s changing, why we believe we’re changing it, the impacts that could have, and the options we have to mitigate the situation.

	<field name="course_intro">Globalization of Business Enterprise
The majority of businesses say they want to become more global. And business leaders say that the lack of people with global intelligence is the key constraint holding them back. This course will address both gaps — at the business and the personal level, it will focus on practical strategies for dealing with the real consequences of globalization.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
The GLOBE course was developed and refined during the term of Professor Ghemawat’s membership of the AACSB taskforce on the globalization of business education. 

This course begins by debunking some of the many myths that surround globalization—what Professor Ghemawat refers to as &quot;globaloney&quot;.

After discussing what globalization isn’t, this course devotes several sessions to understanding what globalization is. It will focus on the differences between countries that underlie observed levels of globalization and their implications for business. These differences will be summarized in terms of a framework for thinking about distances developed by Professor Ghemawat that is widely used at leading business schools around the world.

The final part of the course will synthesize the implications of globalization for business strategies—and for your personal development and career trajectories.  

Praise

&quot;Pankaj Ghemawat is one of those rare individuals who combines world class scholarship with a deep knowledge of business practice.&quot; 

Michael E. Porter, Bishop William Lawrence University Professor, Harvard Business School

“Pankaj Ghemawat’s framework is both visionary and pragmatic—aware of the broad historic trajectories of globalization, but grounded in the real kinds of decisions business leaders have to make now.”
Samuel J. Palmisano, Former Chairman and CEO, IBM

“Pankaj Ghemawat has provided an impressive and comprehensive analysis of the world’s situation in times of globalization and strong economic and social imbalances.&quot;
Mohammed Yunus, Winner of the Nobel Prize for Peace

Course Syllabus
The course is broken up into eight sessions.

Session 1: Globalization and Globaloney 

This session will focus on how globalized the world is, how the data in that regard compare with people’s intuitions on the subject, possible reasons for the discrepancies observed, and their implications.

Session 2: The CAGE Distance Framework

This session will focus on understanding the cross-country differences that underlie observed levels of globalization, summarized in terms of the CAGE distance framework, where “CAGE” is an acronym for Cultural, Administrative (institutional and political), Geographic and Economic distances among countries.

The four sessions that follow will look in greater depth at each of the components of the CAGE framework and their implications for business.

Session 3: Cultural Distance

This session will focus on cultural distance, which encompasses differences in religious beliefs, race/ethnicity, language, and social norms and values.

Session 4: Administrative Distance

This session will focus on administrative differences, by looking at how international differences in capital and labor systems affect the ways in which business enterprises are structured and governed around the world.

Session 5: Geographic Distance

This session will look at how cross-border interactions are influenced by physical distance and by other geographic considerations, such as whether contiguity, within-country distances to borders, access to the ocean, topography, and even time zones. Attention will also be paid to the degree to which cross-border interactions are regionalized.

Session 6: Economic Distance

Consumer wealth and income and the cost of labor are the most obvious (and related) determinants of economic distance between countries. This module will focus on these and others differences such as availability (or lack) of resources, inputs, infrastructure and complements, and organizational capabilities.

Session 7: The Implications of Distances for Business Strategy

This session will review three broad strategies for dealing with differences:  Adaptation to adjust to differences across countries to achieve some local responsiveness; Aggregation, to overcome some of the differences across countries and thereby unlock  cross-border economies of scale/scope; and Arbitrage to exploit some of  the differences across countries in order to achieve absolute efficiency.

Session 8: The Implications of Distances for Personal Strategy

This session will focus on the individual rather than the company level and will discuss, in particular, some of the implications for personal development. It will also provide a course summary.



Recommended Background
While no particular background is required for this course, some interest in globalization and knowledge of basic business concepts will be helpful.

Suggested Readings
All of the required course readings will be listed in the course syllabus provided to you in advance of the course, and will be provided for free. Actually, what will often be required is one of two or more readings covering the same topic but of different lengths and complexity, so that you can customize preparation to your background and interests as well as the amount of time that you have available.

Optional readings that you might find helpful for the course include:

Redefining Global Strategy: Crossing Borders in a World Where Differences Still Matter, Pankaj Ghemawat, Harvard Business School Press, 2007

World 3.0: Global Prosperity and How to Achieve it, Pankaj Ghemawat, Harvard Business Review Press, 2011

Course Format
The course is divided into eight sessions. These sessions include a number of elements, described below. For each session, you can expect to spend a minimum of three hours to complete the assigned materials and tasks. As noted above, additional materials will also be suggested that will allow you to go deeper into the issues discussed, but that will require more time.

Each session will be introduced with a video of approximately 10 to 20 minutes each.  Some of the sessions will require you to complete online surveys before you view the videos. Quizzes will be embedded within the lectures to help you evaluate your understanding of course concepts.

For each session, readings will be assigned that discuss course concepts in more detail and present intuition and applications. 

In some sessions, discussion forums will be used to discuss case studies. These case studies are meant to serve as vehicles for applying course concepts to particular businesses. Your active participation in these discussions is strongly encouraged.

Finally, a peer-assessed assignment will be an important part of the course and will require you to analyze your country—or one of particular interest to you—in relation to others.

FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.

What resources will I need for this class?
In addition to the readings, you will be given free access to a cutting-edge, web-based tool: the CAGE ComparatorTM (http://www.ghemawat.com/cage/). This online tool can be used to undertake quantitative analysis based on the CAGE framework.</field>

Few people who “just Google it” to find an answer to their every question understand just what the company does (and why). Through this course, you&#39;ll join the minority that really gets it.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Google Inc. is one of the key success stories of the Internet era. The company has expanded beyond its original search business through innovation and acquisition to touch the lives of nearly every person who lives life online. For example, Americans spend more than 3,400 hours per year using consumer media, the field where Google’s impact is most profound, and citizens around the world must understand what the company has wrought not only to control our offline and online environments, but also to interact and engage successfully with anyone in our professional and personal lives.

Enrollees in this course learn how to understand the tactics that modern media companies, journalists, marketers, politicians, technologists, and social networks are using to reach them and affect their behavior. They learn how to adopt strategies that put them on an even footing with these entities in achieving their own communications goals. They 

think about, react to, and write about half a dozen important books about Google; 
read a sampling of newspaper and magazine reportage from Google’s entire history;
monitor news sites and specialized blogs about the company and its competitors;
take note of their own usage of Google and other online resources; and
learn how to anticipate the future impact of the company and its competitors on information consumption, creation, and distribution. 
This is the second session of this Coursera course. If you like, you can learn more about it from the links on this page of Professor Youngman&#39;s blog: http://owenyoungman.com/mooc2013

	<field name="course_intro">Grow to Greatness: Smart Growth for Private Businesses, Part I
This course focuses on the common growth challenges faced by existing private businesses when they attempt to grow substantially.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Most entrepreneurship courses focus on how to start a business. Few focus on the next big entrepreneurial inflection point: how do you successfully grow an existing private business? This is the focus of this Course. It is based on the instructor&#39;s research and thirty years of real-world experience advising private growth companies. 

This Course will challenge how you think about growth; give you tools to help you plan for growth, assess the preconditions to grow, and manage the risks of growth. You will study stories of how five different private businesses faced their growth challenges. 

Growth, if not properly managed, can overwhelm a business, destroying value and in many cases even causing the business to fail. However, the research shows that every growth business faces common challenges. You can learn from others&#39; experience—you do not have to &quot;reinvent the wheel&quot;.

The Course format is case based. Each case tells a compelling story. You will learn from Julie Allinson, Susan Fellers, Dave Lindsey, Parik Laxinarayan and Eric Barger. In addition, each week, we will discuss a different content theme. In Weeks and 2 and 5, you will engage in Workshops where you will be asked to use and apply the Course tools and concepts to create growth strategies for two different real-life businesses. You will have the opportunity to create a Course Community of fellow-students to learn from each other as the Course progresses. 

You will learn about the: &quot;3 Myths of Growth&quot;; the &quot;Truth About Growth&quot;;  why growth is like &quot;Mother Nature&quot;; the &quot;Gas Pedal&quot; approach to growth; the all important &quot;4 Ps&quot; of how to grow; and how to scale a business strategically.
Course Syllabus
Please see Syllabus for further detail on weekly reading and assignments.

Week 1: The &quot;Truth About Growth&quot;:The common beliefs that all growth is good; bigger is always better; and businesses must &quot;grow or die&quot; are not true. Growth can be good and growth can be bad. There is no scientific basis for the axiom &quot;grow or die&quot;. It is a fiction. You will lean from Julie Allinson, the founder of Eyebobs, who has built a successful business selling stylish “reading glasses for the irreverent and slightly jaded.” Julie approached growth realistically and understood its value creation and destructive powers. You will learn how she faced manufacturing, sales, and people challenges while building a high growth business—a cool story.

Week 2: Workshop—“Are You Ready for Growth?”:  Using the Growth Risks Assessment Tool from Week 1, you will meet and advise Susan Fellers, the founder of 3 Fellers Bakery. Susan started a business baking gluten-free products when she was diagnosed with celiac disease. Her start-up was successful, and she needs your help because she has had so many growth alternatives and she does not know which to pursue. You will be asked to create a growth plan for her. 

Week 3: The 4 Ps of Growth—Planning, Prioritization, Processes and Pace: Using the Defender Direct story, we will learn to better manage the chaos of growth; find a business&#39;s strategic focus; how to choose which daily &quot;fires&quot; to put out first; how to create replicable processes—“leave a fire extinguisher behind&quot;; and how to pace growth letting &quot;up on the growth gas pedal&quot;. Dave Lindsey is our business builder this week, and you will trace his story from starting his business in his home to today being a national, privately owned home installation company generating well in excess of $300M (USD) in revenue with healthy profit numbers. 

Week 4: The Four Ways To Grow a Business: This week you will learn about the different ways to grow—improvements, innovation, scaling, and strategic acquisitions—with a focus on growth boosters: how to get more customers and sell more products and/or services to existing customers more efficiently. Enchanting Travels, a travel company based in India, is our story this week. You will learn how they built the foundation of their business to scale their focused customer value proposition so they could grow geographically to Africa, South America, and Asia. The story presents a big decision for you: should they franchise their business?

Week 5: Workshop—“Creating a Growth Plan&quot;: This week you will read about Eric Barger&#39;s challenge: how to take a business that has had little growth selling a commodity product and turn it into a high growth business. You will be asked to create a growth plan for Eric. And after doing that you will learn what Eric did to quadruple his business in three years. 
Recommended Background

Course Format
Videos and Workshops
Each week consists of videos made for the Course in short segments of approximately 10 to 25 minutes each. The videos discuss the articles and case studies to be read prior to the class. There are in-video quizzes embedded within the segments to evaluate your understanding of the concepts. You may proceed at your own pace. 
There are also Workshop exercises, in which you have the opportunity to use the concepts discussed in the readings and videos to determine a course of action for a real, private business growth challenge. After completing the exercises, you will learn what action the business actually took and whether it was successful. 

There is a (non-optional) final exam of multiple choice questions. 

Discussion Forums
You may choose to create course communities through the Discussion Forums, which will allow you to learn from your classmates. Communities can be formed based on your country of residence or based on the type of business you own or want to learn about. The purpose of the community is to provide a forum for you to learn from each other. It’s an opportunity for you create and grow together. 

Instructor Engagement
I will hold &quot;office hours&quot; every Wednesday morning during the Course from 10:00am to 11:30am EST where I will be on the Course Discussion Forum to answer questions, chat and respond to other conversations. I will also hold a &quot;live&quot; streaming session of Office Hours at least once during the Course. 
FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.
How will I learn in this Course?
This Course is based on the principle that one learns by doing. There are required and optional readings. You will be asked to apply concepts discussed in the videos and readings in Workshop exercises, and if you choose to join a Course Community, you will learn from each other.

What resources will I need for this Course?
None. The Darden Graduate School of Business at the University of Virginia is providing this Course for free because of its mission to positively impact society. Darden Business Publishing will provide all required Course reading for free.

Why is this Course important?
Growing private businesses is in many parts of the world a major job creator and a key route to building a better life for oneself and one&#39;s family. In effect, this Course is about the pursuit of hopes and dreams. I think doing business is much more than just about making money. Doing business is the primary way many people achieve their hopes and dreams to provide a better life for themselves and their families. And in doing so, building a business can also create value for employees, customers, and society.

What is the coolest thing I&#39;ll learn if I take this Course?
By bringing real-life business growth stories and challenges to you, this Course will teach you a different way to think about business growth and an appreciation for how managing risks and constant learning and improvement are critical to business success. You will also acquire tools, such as the 4 Ps in Week 2, that can help you manage your life.</field>

Fluent English language literacy as well as grammatical and mechanical knowledge is required. You will need familiarity with a basic word-processing program (for example, Word, OpenOffice, Google Docs, Pages), basic image software (for example, PowerPoint, iPhoto, Photoshop, Picasa) or cameras (for example, smartphones, digital cameras), and basic audio recording software (for example, Audacity, GarageBand).
Suggested Readings
See course syllabus for required and suggested readings. The final syllabus will be available two weeks before the course begins.
Course Format
This class consists of two short introductory videos (a welcome video and a technology video), 24 ten-minute videos (three videos per week), plus approximately eight 20-to-30-minute recorded &quot;Hangout&quot; discussion sessions. These videos are complemented by additional written, oral, and visual materials; student activities; and web-based assessments.
FAQ
What kind of time will I need to take this course? You should plan 5-7 hours per week, but not in one block. We recommend that you plan 30-to-60-minute blocks, so that you have time to reflect between sessions when you’re working on a text, visual, or oral presentation. 

What are the most useful things I&#39;ll learn if I take this class? You’ll develop a stronger sense of process (how to approach and complete tasks), leading to increased confidence in completing and assessing written, visual, and oral communication projects. 

What resources will I need for this class? Beyond a positive attitude, time to do the readings and assignments, and a willingness to work, you will need regular access to a computer, a connection to the Internet, and basic software for doing written, visual, and oral activities. While you can use commercial software if you already own it, all of the software you need is free and available online (a list of some software resources is on the syllabus). You do not need to buy a textbook; instead, you will be referred to free, online texts—Writing Commons and the PurdueOWL. 

Will I receive transferable college course credit? This course is intended to introduce you to principles and practices of first-year composition. It is not intended as a substitute for a for-credit composition course at any college or university. Even though this course is not intended to be given college credit, it can demonstrate that you have learned a great deal. To keep a record of your accomplishments in this course, you should create a portfolio of your written, visual, and oral assignments. At some colleges and universities, your portfolio may form a portion of a case you might make for potential transfer credit. Every college has its own policy for acceptance of transfer or examination credit. 

Will I get feedback on my written work? Yes. You will receive peer assessments of your work. In addition, Professor Head and her teaching team will model effective feedback practices so class members can respond productively to one another. Most important for developing competence and confidence, you will learn how to assess your own work. We will also hold weekly virtual discussions and use selected projects for examples (anonymously and with your permission). 

Will this course provide instruction on grammar? No. Mechanics (for example, punctuation, capitalization, spelling) and grammar are important, so you’ll be given references to check mechanics and grammar. However, this course focuses on creating effective writing, visuals, and oral presentations. 

Is the course appropriate if a student is not very proficient in the English language? This course is about composing in English, so all course work must be completed in English. You will need English fluency to be successful in the course. Because we welcome cultural and linguistic diversity, part of our discussions will focus on the ways different people use language and the different expectations people bring to communication.</field>

	<field name="course_intro">Grow to Greatness: Smart Growth for Private Businesses, Part II
This course focuses on the common human resource (&quot;people&quot;) challenges faced by existing private businesses when they attempt to grow substantially. PART 1 OF THE GROW TO GREATNESS COURSE IS NOT A PREREQUISITE FOR TAKING THIS COURSE.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Most entrepreneurship courses focus on how to start a business. Few focus on the next big entrepreneurial inflection point: how do you successfully grow an existing private business? This is the focus of this Course. It is based on the instructor&#39;s research and thirty years of real-world experience advising private growth companies.
 
This Course will focus on the common “people” challenges private growth companies face as they grow. You will study stories of how six different private businesses faced their growth challenges.
 
While strategic focus and operational excellence are necessary to build a great growth company, they are not sufficient. Growth requires the right kind of leadership, culture, and people. My research clearly showed that many entrepreneurs struggle with personal challenges presented to them by growth, as well as the challenge of hiring the right people and building the right management team that can play well together. The research shows that every growth business faces common challenges. You can learn from others&#39; experience—you do not have to &quot;reinvent the wheel&quot;.
 
The Course format is story based. Each case tells a compelling story. You will learn from Barbara Lynch, Ryan Dienst, Steve Ritter, Randy Bufford, John Gabbert, and Mike Cote. In addition, each week, we will discuss a different content theme. In Week 3, you will engage in a Workshop where you will be asked to apply the Growth System Assessment Tool. You will have the opportunity to create a Course Community of fellow students to learn from each other as the Course progresses.
 
You will learn how entrepreneurs must grow, too; the “secret” of high performance; people-centric leadership; how to create high employee engagement; how to create an internal Growth System; and how to build a senior management team.
Course Syllabus
Please see Syllabus for further detail on weekly reading and assignments.
 
Week 1: The Entrepreneur Must Grow, Too! In order for a business to grow, the entrepreneur must grow. First, the entrepreneur’s role will evolve from primarily being a “doer” to a manager then to a leader and ultimately to being a coach/mentor. Additionally the entrepreneur in most cases moves from being a specialist to a generalist to ultimately being a “conductor”. We will learn from Barbara Lynch, a much-heralded Chef who, with little formal education or training, built a multi-concept restaurant “empire” in Boston, and from Ryan Dienst, one of the founders of Global Medical Imaging.
 
Week 2: The “Secret” of High Performance is High Employee Engagement. Using the Leaders Bank and Trilogy Health Services stories we will look at how two businesses put in place people policies, practices, and a leadership model that led to high employee engagement, loyalty, and productivity that drove high customer satisfaction. We will also focus on the principles of people-centric leadership. During this Week, you will engage with Community members in Workshop learning.
 
Week 3: Growth Is Much More Than a Strategy—It Requires a SYSTEM. Growth is behavioral. To enable and promote the desired behaviors, entrepreneurs have to create an internal aligned system that links, in a consistent self-reinforcing manner, strategy/business model, culture, structure, leadership behaviors, measurements, and rewards. This week we will learn from John Gabbert, who built highly successful retail home furnishings chain Room &amp; Board his way, rejecting the common business practices of his industry. My MBA students find this story mindboggling. If you have work experience, you will also use the Growth System Assessment Tool.
 
Week 4: The Surprising Difficulties in Building a Senior Management Team.  I was surprised in my research at how difficult it was for entrepreneur’s to build a senior management team. In many cases it took multiple hirings to get the right fit. And even then, getting the senior management team to “play well together” was challenging. Lastly, most entrepreneurs were not prepared for the need to “upgrade” their management team as the business grew. This week we will study how Mike Cote took over as CEO of SecureWorks, a floundering Internet security company, and grew it into an industry leader ultimately selling the company last year to Dell for hundreds of millions of dollars.

Part of the &quot;Cybersecurity&quot; Specialization »
In this course, we will study security and trust from the hardware perspective. Upon completing the course, students will understand the vulnerabilities in current digital system design flow and the physical attacks to these systems. They will learn that security starts from hardware design and be familiar with the tools and skills to build secure and trusted hardware.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Hardware is the root of computation and communication. It is the enabler of any software, algorithm, or communication protocols. All the computation will eventually be carried out by hardware, namely the processor or the circuits.

In this course, we will study security and trust from the hardware perspective. We will start with a short survey of the roles of hardware in security and trust. With all types of dedicated hardware/circuits, known as co-processors, being developed to speed up application specific computations, hardware’s role changes from the enabler to an enhancer. Nowadays, hardware becomes the enforcer for secure systems because it is used to ensure that only the authenticated user and software can access the processor. However, current hardware design flow does not have security as a key design objective. Consequently, we will conduct several case studies where hardware turns into the weakest link in secure systems.

Then we will review the fundamentals of digital logic design and use this as an example to analyze the source of security vulnerabilities and demonstrate how these vulnerabilities can become legitimate security threats. We conclude with the basic principles and practical methods of design for security and trust, as well as a study of the associated design cost.  

Next, we introduce physical attacks to popular digital systems such as smart cards and FPGA-based systems. We will focus on side-channel attacks, which have been demonstrated many times to be able to successfully reveal the secret cryptographic keys stored in the secure systems. These attacks include power analysis, timing attacks, and electromagnetic attacks. Standard countermeasures to these attacks will also be introduced.

Finally we will learn the new hardware security primitives that can help us to build secure systems. We will see how the trust platform module (TPM) works; what is a silicon physical unclonable function (PUF) and why it is useful for system security; what is a hardware Trojan horse and the security threats it brings to the system; why counterfeiting becomes a serious problem for hardware design intellectual property protection.

Upon completing the course, students will understand the vulnerabilities in current digital system design flow and the physical attacks to these systems. They will learn that security starts from hardware design and be familiar with the tools and skills to build secure and trusted hardware.

	<field name="course_intro">Global Health and Humanitarianism
Is humanitarianism an effective, justifiable and sustainable response to ill-health, inequality, injustice and war?</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Global health is public health at the global level. It deals with the interconnections between peoples from all over the world. It is based on the idea that it is necessary to cooperate internationally to respond to diseases, disasters and conflicts which now threaten us all. Humanitarianism, in all its various forms, is one such response. In attempting to organise a humanitarian intervention, though, we are confronted by a wide range of problems. Most acute of these is the intense inequality which marks the contemporary world. Public health – its capacities, delivery structures and finances – is profoundly different for the 1 billion people who live in the world’s wealthier countries. Those elsewhere have much more limited access to publicly funded or privately insured medicine. As a consequence, non-governmental humanitarian organisations now deliver a large proportion of the world’s health care.

This course introduces these issues by looking first at the vague, yet highly contested, notion a global health agenda. It then goes on to consider how and why the world’s wealthier countries have sought to develop a response to the emergencies and crises that the vulnerabilities of others have produced. Here, public pressure and the ethical imperative to bear witness when confronted with such suffering are especially important. Finally, the course considers whether or not humanitarian assistance can be considered a right. It looks at the emerging Responsibility to Protect agenda and the associated moral dilemmas around sovereignty, post-colonialism and duty-based ethics.
 Within this context, the course explores these critical normative and logistical questions:

Is humanitarian aid as a concept, as simple as the rich helping the poor?
Are these interventions well-meaning and effective?
Should governments be committing tax revenues – involuntarily given – to improve the health of others far away?
Do those that can afford it have a responsibility to act in some way?
What does receipt of aid mean for the recipient country, its leadership, its future, and its responsibility?
Must people be helped only according to need, regardless of what a regime might have done?
Must humanitarians remain neutral – silent perhaps – in the face of injustice in order to ensure access?
Must the causes of inequality, suffering and violence be ignored in favour of access, action and outcome?
Each of the 3 sessions below is built around a series of interviews with 3 leading figures in the humanitarian world. The first, Professor Tony Redmond OBE, is a Consultant in Emergency Medicine and a founding member of the College of Emergency Medicine. He was founding Editor of the Emergency Medicine Journal and a founder the Resuscitation Council. His interest in disaster management began with the earthquake in Armenia in 1988 (where he was appointed to the Soviet Order for Personal Courage) and he has since responded to a range of humanitarian crises in Kurdistan, Bosnia, Serbia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Cape Verde, Kosovo, Kenya, Iran, Pakistan, China and Haiti. In 1994 he established UK-Med, an NGO that now hosts the UK International Emergency Trauma Register. He is currently Professor of Emergency Medicine at the Humanitarian and Conflict Response Institute at the University of Manchester and Chair of the Foreign Medical Teams Working Group at the World health Organisation.

The second, Professor Rony Brauman, is Director of the Humanitarian and Conflict Response Institute at the University of Manchester. He has worked in the field of international medical assistance since 1977. He has served as a field physician in Thailand, Chad, Somalia, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Lebanon, Angola, Somalia, Afghanistan, primarily with Médecins Sans Frontières (France). He became the President of the organization from 1982 -1994. During this period, MSF became recognized as the largest and the most effective transnational not-for-profit medical agency in the world and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1999. He was awarded the &quot;Prix Henry Dunant&quot; in 1997 and currently lectures at the Institut d&#39;Études Politiques (Paris) and is Director of Research at the MSF Foundation also in Paris.

 The third, Professor Mukesh Kapila CBE, is Professor of Global Health and Humanitarian Affairs in the Humanitarian and Conflict Response Institute at the University of Manchester. He is also Special Representative of the Aegis Trust and Chair of Minority Rights Group International. Previously, he was Under Secretary General at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. Earlier, he served as Special Adviser to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva and then to the UN Mission in Afghanistan. Subsequently, he led the UN’s largest country mission at the time as the United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for the Sudan, and then became a Director at the World Health Organization. Prior to the UN, Professor Kapila was at the UK&#39;s Department for International Development, initially as senior health and population adviser and latterly as the first head of a new Conflict and Humanitarian Affairs Department that he set up.

Course Syllabus
Week One: What is Global Health?
This introductory session will provide graphical representations of differences globally of access to healthcare for maternal and child health and reasons for the variety – logistics, culture, money, skilled workers, education, etc. It will contrast Europe, the Americas, Africa, India and Pacific region and provide examples of how access to health care varies so greatly.

It will ask four basic questions:

1. Why does access to health care vary across continents, not just globally?

2. What is the most influential factor in access to healthcare?

3. What strategies are evolving to improve equity of access to healthcare?

4. Will this be an ongoing problem globally?


Week Two: Global Health Actors

This session will provide an overview of the main actors helping to define, and evolve, global health: international, government, private, individuals, foundations and their individual agendas. It will introduce the main actors and their perceived agendas. It will discuss private influences, NGOs, foundations and local government and show how they engage and interact with each other in the global health arena – is there one aim or are they policy driven? It will look at the sphere guidelines in this regard before going on to present a case report on how three different agencies (MSF / WHO / Fundation) approach the same global health issue – the 2010-13 cholera outbreak in Haiti.

 

Week Three: Humanitarian Responses

Humanitarian crises exert great cost. The Japanese tsunami in 2011 is estimated to have cost $300bn. The Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004 probably killed in excess of 400,000 people (mostly in Indonesia).  Civil wars have, since 1945, killed over 20 million people and displaced a further 67 million, 90% of whom have been non-combatants. Responding to such a litany of misery has increasingly taken the form of humanitarianism, which has seen large increases in expenditure since the 1980s. In this part of the course, we will look at the vulnerabilities that underpin war and disaster in the developing world (as the home of the great majority of these events). We will consider the phases, challenges and politics of humanitarian responses and ask why is that resource-poor environments are so prone to such occurrences.

 

Week Four: Humanitarian Dilemmas and the Problem of Bearing Witness

Humanitarianism is, at its very heart, political. It immediately opens up profound ethical questions. This has become increasingly apparent as aid agencies have moved away from the single-mandate approach of the Cold War and towards combined programmes of relief, development and peace-building. This part of the course will trace out some of the difficulties that this has generated. In particular, it will consider the shift from duty-based ethics to a focus on the consequences of humanitarian intervention. We will look at two organisations&#39; responses to two seminal crises in the 1990s - MSF-France&#39;s decision to withdraw from the refugee camps on the Rwanda border in 1994 and the ICRC&#39;s refusal to testify to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in 1999.

 

Week Five: The Right to Humanitarian Assistance

As the world becomes more interconnected as a result of globalisation, increased migration and technology, disasters (both natural and man-made) are no longer of local but global concern. The right to assistance for those affected by such conflict (internal and international) and natural disasters are at the forefront of humanitarian action. Multiple humanitarian agencies and government bodies are heavily involved in the provision of assistance to those in need. Yet the right to humanitarian assistance is very much an area of humanitarianism that is open to debate: does a right to humanitarian assistance actually exist? In many cases the rights of the individual in need of assistance are often compromised by broader concerns of national sovereignty and international politics.

 

Week Six: Responsibility to Protect

 

Moving on from the previous section where we examined the right to humanitarian assistance and the obstacles and challenges surrounding its practice, this session will explore another controversial issue within humanitarianism: the responsibility to protect (hereafter referred to as R2P). The principle R2P recognizes not only the need for states to protect their own citizens from genocide and other mass atrocities, it also sets the precedent that if such states are unable to do so, then the international community will step in and provide the much needed protection and humanitarian assistance to those affected. Since its adoption by UN members in 2005, the practice of R2P has suffered from inconsistent application around the world, raising concerns over national sovereignty and the motivations of those behind R2P operations. This session will explore the concept in more depth, charting its rise from 2001 as well as shedding light on some of the main challenges it faces.

ABOUT THE COURSE

Almost everyone will be a patient at some point in their lives. Estimates suggest that over 98,000 patients die in US hospitals each year due to medical errors; making medical errors a leading cause of death. Adverse events in healthcare often result from problems in the complex systems of care. Improving patient safety demands a complex system-wide effort, involving a wide range of actions in performance improvement, environmental safety and risk management. Healthcare professionals and consumers must partner in these efforts.

The content of this course has been adapted from the intensive five-day Patient Safety Certificate Program offered by the Johns Hopkins Armstrong Institute for Patient Safety and Quality as well as the Helene Fuld Fellows Program undergraduate course content from the Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing.

This course will explore the many problems of the American health care system and discuss the specific ways that the Affordable Care Act will impact access, quality, costs, as well as medical innovation.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
The American health care system has many problems. 50 million people are uninsured. Quality is extremely uneven, with peaks of greatness at leading academic centers but overall poor quality in both process measures and outcomes such as asthma deaths. Finally, the U.S. health care system spends over $8000 per patient per year, nearly double the next highest country. In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted. Over the next decade or more, the Act will dramatically re-structure the American health care system.

This course will explore the history and structure of the current American health care system, including the history of and problems with employment-based health insurance, the challenges surrounding access, cost and quality, and the medical malpractice conundrum. The course will then explore the history of health care reform and the challenges that were overcome to achieve health reform in America. Finally, we will delineate the specific ways that the Affordable Care Act improves access and quality, and will control costs. Throughout lessons regarding health economics, health policy, and medical practice will be elucidated.

This class is open to anyone that is interested in gaining a better understanding of the US health care system and the challenges of health care reform. There are no prerequisites or required knowledge of the health system.

Course Syllabus
Week 1 – Growth in US Health Care
Much of the impetus for health care reform is provided by the need to “bend the cost curve.”  Over the past few decades, health care cost growth has consistently outpaced overall economic growth, taking up an increasing share of our Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and government budgets.  We will discuss the factors that drive cost growth.
Live Q &amp; A with Dr. Emanuel
Dr. Emanuel will host a live online Q &amp; A session on topics related to health care and current events.

Week 2 – Structure of the US Health Care
How do Americans get their health care? Who pays for it? How did the system we have today come to be?  These are some of the questions we will answer this week when we look at the structure of the US health care system

Week 3 – Access to and Quality of Health Care in the US
Most Americans receive insurance through their employer or the government (e.g. Medicaid, Medicare, CHIP).  Before the ACA, approximately 50 million Americans did not have health insurance. This week we explore access to health care insurance, the profile of the average uninsured person, disparities in quality and outcomes, and the link between insurance and access to health care.

Week 4 – Health Care Malpractice
In some physician specialties, as many as one in four practitioners a year have a medical malpractice claim filed against them, making this a matter of frequent public and policy debate. We will discuss medical errors, the workings of the malpractice system, liability insurance, and the contribution of negligence and malpractice costs to the health system’s overall bottom line. 

Week 5 – History of health care reform; The ACA: An Overview 
Health care reform in America has been 100 years in the making, starting with Theodore Roosevelt and continuing through the Clinton administration. We discuss past attempts at health care reform and why they met with resistance. We then move on to an overview of the 2010 Affordable Care Act.

Week 6 - The ACA: Access to Health Care
The overview of the ACA continues with a discussion of the provisions designed to expand access to health care.  We will cover employer-sponsored health insurance provisions. This session will feature a guest lecture by J. Sanford Schwartz, M.D.

Week 7 – The ACA: Cost Control
This week we will discuss projections of health care cost growth under the ACA, followed by mechanisms through which the ACA aims to tackle health care cost growth. 

Week 8 – The ACA: Health Care Delivery and Quality
The final topic of the course is the ACA’s impact on the quality and delivery of care. The ACA includes provisions for institutional innovations, i.e. changes in how the system delivers care.  It also contains rules and incentives for providers to cut down on mistakes and deliver proven, valuable care. This week will provide a forward-looking overview of what we will change in the medical sector.

Course Format
This class is eight weeks long. Each week, students will watch approximately 30 - 40 minutes of lectures delivered by Dr. Emanuel. Students should expect to spend 2 - 5 hours per week reading related materials from the reading list, all of which are freely accessible online.

Students taking the course for a grade will complete one short essay question (approximately 1 page) per week, which will be peer-graded based on a detailed answer key provided after the due date. Of the eight scores earned for assignments, the lowest two scores will be dropped in calculating the final grade. The remaining six scores will be weighted equally. As a result, students who miss a homework assignment can still earn full credit in the course. There are no exams or final projects in this course. Students not taking the course for a grade may choose not to complete the assignments.

The details of these logistics are subject to change; if changes are made, students will be notified via an announcement and this page will be updated.


FAQ
Course

Will this content be available after the course is over? 
Yes, we intend to maintain this information online.
Will I receive college credit for this course?
Coursera and the University of Pennsylvania do not provide college credit for this course, however, students who satisfactorily complete the course requirements will receive a certificate of completion.
How many students are in this class?
This information reaches a large number of people.  In the summer of 2012, 17,246 people were signed up to take the course on the first week of lectures and 31,967 people were registered by end of the course.  However, of those students, 3,428 submitted the first assignment and 1,066 submitted the final assignment.  1,340 people completed at least five assignments and 1,023 people passed the course.  While there is more attrition than in a traditional classroom, this is in part due to the online, free aspect of the course as people may sign up who are curious, but are not interested in completing the course.  This course offers significant flexibility for students in terms of not only when you do the work, but also how much you complete.  Some students wish to learn as much as possible about the topic while others are interested in learning only a portion of the material.  Students complete the work because they are genuinely interested in learning the material.
I joined the class late.  Can I still participate? 
The top 6 of 8 assignments are calculated for your grade.  Thus you may miss 2 assignments without impacting your grade.  Even if you joined too late to pass the course, you may participate in the class at any point by watching the videos, reading the material, and participating in the forums. 
Readings:

Why did you select these readings?
The readings are limited to those which are freely available to the public, to facilitate anyone participating in the course.  Students widely range in their background and health care experience.  Thus, while the selected readings are generally at college level, they assume a student will have only a basic understanding of the American health care system.  Additional optional readings are provided for those who wish to delve deeper into a particular topic.
Why do you have optional readings?
Some people may be interesting in learning more about a topic.  For those students, we have identified optional readings.  These optional readings provide background material or more in-depth information on a topic.  You will be graded only on information in the required readings.
Assignments:

I can’t complete an assignment.  Will I fail?
The top 6 of 8 assignments are calculated for your grade.  Thus you may miss 2 assignments without impacting your grade. 
How will I be graded?
You are given one assignment each week.  The top 6 of 8 assignments are calculated for your grade.  Thus you may miss 2 assignments without impacting your grade.  For each assignment, you will be graded by a minimum of four other people.  The high and low score for each assignment will be tossed out and the other scores averaged.
Am I required to participate in the forums?  Are the quizzes graded?
Participation in the forums and quizzes available through the video content are not graded.
How will I grade others?
Reviewers will receive a grading rubric and sample answer.
How will you ensure that the grades are fair?
We expect students are motivated to participate in their education and we ask that everyone grade each other in an objective, fair, and unbiased manner.  Grading will be double-blind; graders will not know whose work they are grading, and students will not know who graded their work.  Each assignment is graded by several different people, which will reduce any potential bias, with the high and low scores dropped for each student.  Furthermore, the selection of assignments to grade for each person will be random each week, so any given student is unlikely to have his/her work graded by any given student grader more than once.  Finally, we will be checking the grading for consistency (e.g. by comparing against grades assigned by the instructor to a few &quot;sample&quot; assignments).
Why do you require students to grade each other?
This course is freely available on the internet.  During the summer 2012 course, 31, 967 students signed up for the course.  Coursera and the University of Pennsylvania are not able to support providing this course free for everyone without utilizing innovative and non-traditional grading mechanisms.  We also believe that in grading each other, you will learn the material better.
What happens if I grade more assignments one week than the minimum required?  Will I get extra credit?
You will receive the appreciation of your classmates and hopefully a greater understanding of the material.  You will not, however, receive any extra credit.
Can I grade extra assignments one week to make up for grading fewer assignments another week?
No.  You are required to grade a minimum of five assignments each week.
Technical

Please provide a spell-check option.
Until Coursera is able to provide this option, we suggest that you draft your answer in Word, spell-check it, and then copy and paste your answer into the answer box.
How do I copy my answer into the assignment submission box?  It does not work.
This is possibly a browser issue; Coursera is optimized for Google Chrome.  Try using the command keys to copy and paste your answer from Word: Ctrl-A (highlight all), Ctrl-C (copy), and Ctrl-V (paste).
How do you close the window for the multiple-choice question to resume the lecture video after the quizzes pop up?
This is possibly a browser issue.  Coursera supports modern web standards and the many devices that run browsers that support these features.  Chrome, Firefox, IE (9-10), and Safari meet these requirements.

	<field name="course_intro">Heterogeneous Parallel Programming
This course introduces concepts, languages, techniques, and patterns for programming heterogeneous, massively parallel processors. Its contents and structure have been significantly revised based on the experience gained from its initial offering in 2012. It covers heterogeneous computing architectures, data-parallel programming models, techniques for memory bandwidth management, and parallel algorithm patterns.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
All computing systems, from mobile to supercomputers, are becoming heterogeneous, massively parallel computers for higher power efficiency and computation throughput. While the computing community is racing to build tools and libraries to ease the use of these systems, effective and confident use of these systems will always require knowledge about low-level programming in these systems. This course is designed for students to learn the essence of low-level programming interfaces and how to use these interfaces to achieve application goals. CUDA C, with its good balance between user control and verboseness, will serve as the teaching vehicle for the first half of the course. Students will then extend their learning into closely related programming interfaces such as OpenCL, OpenACC, and C++AMP.


The course is unique in that it is application oriented and only introduces the necessary underlying computer science and computer engineering knowledge for understanding. It covers the concept of data parallel execution models, memory models for managing locality, tiling techniques for reducing bandwidth consumption, parallel algorithm patterns, overlapping computation with communication, and a variety of heterogeneous parallel programming interfaces. The concepts learned in this course form a strong foundation for learning other types of parallel programming systems.


Course Syllabus
Week One: Introduction to Heterogeneous Computing, Overview of CUDA C, and Kernel-Based Parallel Programming, with lab tour and programming assignment of vector addition in CUDA C.
 Week Two: Memory Model for Locality, Tiling for Conserving Memory Bandwidth, Handling Boundary Conditions, and Performance Considerations, with programming assignment of simple matrix-matrix multiplication in CUDA C.
Week Three: Parallel Convolution Pattern, with programming assignment of tiled matrix-matrix multiplication in CUDA C.
Week Four: Parallel Scan Pattern, with programming assignment of parallel convolution in CUDA C.
Week Five: Parallel Histogram Pattern and Atomic Operations, with programming assignment of parallel scan in CUDA C.

Week Nine: complete any remaining lab assignments, with optional, bonus programming assignments in choice of OpenCL, C++AMP, or OpenACC.
Recommended Background
Programming experience in C/C++.
Suggested Readings
Although the class is designed to be self-contained, students wanting to expand their knowledge beyond what we can cover in a one-quarter class can find a much more extensive coverage of this topic in the book Programming Massively Parallel Processors: A Hands-on Approach (Applications of GPU Computing Series) -  2nd Edition, by David Kirk and Wen-mei Hwu, published by Morgan Kaufmann (Elsevier), ISBN 0123814723.


Course Format
The class will consist of weekly lecture videos, which are between 15 and 20 minutes in length. There will also be weekly quizzes and programming assignments.

FAQ
Will I get a certificate for this course?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a certificate signed by the instructor.

What resources will I need for this class?
A laptop or desktop computer. GPU enabled hardware can be helpful but will not be required.

Why not teach the whole course using OpenCL?
While OpenCL is an industry standard and widely supported by many CPU and GPU vendors, it is much more complex and tedious to use than CUDA. The complexity and tedious details distract from the concepts and techniques that one should master. From our experience, it is much more productive to use CUDA to teach the concepts and techniques. We will then teach the additional complexities of OpenCL so that students can comfortably apply all the concepts to OpenCL.

How did the students do in the previous offering of the HPP Course?
Out of the 9,908 students who did quizzes and programming assignments,.2,811 received Certificate of Achievement or Certificate of Distinction.

What is the coolest thing I&#39;ll learn if I take this class?
You will learn how to unleash the massive computing power from mobile processors to supercomputers for your applications.</field>

In this course we will learn about the features of higher education that were designed specifically to prepare workers and leaders for the Industrial Age, and we’ll strategize ways that, together, we can change learning--inside of school and out--for the world we live in now--and even to help improve our world. #FutureEd</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Welcome!  This course is designed for anyone concerned with the best ways of learning and thriving in the world we live in now.  It&#39;s for students, teachers, professors, researchers, administrators, policy makers, business leaders, job counselors and recruiters, parents, and lifelong learners around the globe.  The full,  whimsical name of the class is: “The History and Future of (Mostly) Higher Education: Or, How We Can Unlearn Our Old Patterns and Relearn for a Happier, More Productive, Ethical, and Socially-Engaged Future.”  That subtitle is inspired by Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen who has said that &quot;all education is vocational&quot; in the sense that it is our job, as educators, to help train people for the vocation of leading better lives.  

Are we fulfilling that educational objective, from kindergarten to professional school?  Or are we training students with the methods, philosophy, and metrics designed for the Fordist era of the Model T?  Since 1993, when scientists made the Internet widely available, our lives, our work, our occupations, our culture, and our entertainments have changed tremendously.  Far too little has changed inside our educational institutions, in the US and internationally, to prepare us for the demands, problems, restrictions, obstacles,  responsibilities, and possibilities of living in the world we inhabit outside of school.  This course addresses one key question:  How can we all, together, work to redesign higher education for our future... not for someone else’s past?

Bonus: Students enrolled in this Coursera course will also be invited to many onsite and online events, workshops, and conferences offered by more than fifty learning institutions around the world, as part of an initiative on Shaping the Future of Higher Education.


Course Syllabus
Learning Objectives

Understand how and why we inherited the Industrial Age educational systems.
Think deeply about the requirements of the world we live in now.
Discover new ideas, methods, competencies, and subject matter.
Share our pathways to successful innovation with others around the world. Together, we can change schools, classrooms, institutions, learning--and maybe ourselves!  
WEEK ONE - January 27, 2014
Guiding Principles and Driving Concepts - Let’s Get Started 
This week we will think about the uses of history: learning how and why educational institutions were constructed in the past helps us think about what we need now, in order to begin to shape a different future of education in order to help shape a more just future for all.

WEEK TWO - February 3, 2014
The iPod Experiment: Or, Learning vs. Education 
Duke University’s iPod experiment became international news.  Why?  What happens when students are in charge?  What happens when education begins at a place where no one (not even the instructor) knows the answer in advance? What if the actual learning cannot be tested or assessed by the usual methods of higher education? What if learning is also about trying to improve the status quo?  This week we will look at diverse histories and theories of education and learning. 
WEEK THREE - February 10, 2014
Teaching Like It’s 1992     
The World changed on April 22, 1993, when the scientists at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications released the Internet and the World Wide Web to the general public.  From then on, anyone with access to an Internet connection could communicate  to anyone else with an Internet connection.  No editor or publisher provides a safety net now and, at the same time, our data can be hacked, our privacy invaded.  The digital world we live in now comes with tremendous responsibilities and opportunity--and yet it comes with real inequalities, perils, and obstacles too.  Does our educational system prepare us for these challenges? 
WEEK FOUR - February 17, 2014
Welcome to the Future: 10 Ways to Change the Paradigm of Higher Education 
We will now be looking at different principles, methods and metrics for redesigning an innovative form of learning that helps us all navigate the complexities of the world we inhabit outside of school.  This week we focus specifically on innovations to the curriculum. 
WEEK FIVE - February 24, 2014
Innovations in Pedagogy (Methods) and Assessment 
This week we will focus on innovations in pedagogy (the methods for learning) and assessment.  How you teach is what you teach.  And, we need to think deeply about what we value and make sure what we value is what we count.     
WEEK SIX - March 3, 2014
How to Make Institutional Change  
Even if we make changes in our personal learning and teaching methods, we still have to work mostly within institutions of learning.  Institutional change can be difficult; it takes patience, strategy, and allies. This week offers (and also invites) ideas about what we can do together. It makes a powerful argument that we all need to advocate (in any country) for higher education and shows how, in the U.S., the decline in support for public education has contributed to income inequality and hurt all our future.  This week includes interviews with inspiring people who have worked together to make successful change happen in society ad in education, against odds.  


Conclusion: Thank you for joining this movement on behalf of educational innovation and reform!  This is not the end.  It’s the beginning.  Where will we do from here? Let’s get started!  
Recommended Background
The only background required is passionate interest in the future of learning and higher education. All are welcome!

Statement of Accomplishment requirements 
In order to earn a Statement of Accomplishment signed by Cathy Davidson, you will be requried to take weekly multiple choice quizzes (the classic &quot;summative&quot; form of testing that is designed to &quot;sum up&quot; what you have learned). We’ll strive to make these quizzes into useful “reviews&quot; of the week&#39;s content.  We will also talk a lot about the shortcomings of standardized testing and strategize more effective ways of learning and of measuring achievement (such as digital badging). If you wish to earn a Statement of Accomplishment with Distinction you will need to finish three peer assessments in addition to the quizzes.

Optional Participatory Assignments 
This course is not just about content but also about designing new ways of learning. Assignments will encourage international contribution to a historical timeline of global educational innovation--a rich new resource that researchers might be able to build upon.  There will also be an array of practical exercises, examples, methods, and ideas that can be used in any classroom, for home schooling, or in any informal learning or study situation. You will be encouraged to try new methods and to discuss the results in forums, wikis, and on social media. 

Bonus: Students will also learn about dozens of concurrent online and face-to-face events on the topic of education innovation being run at universities, colleges, and community colleges around the world. Find out more!
FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete all of the weekly quizzes (with 70% and above) will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by Cathy Davidson. Students who pass the weekly quizzes with a 70% and above, plus finish three peer assessments, will receive a Statement of Accomplishment with Distinction.</field>

Plagues, Witches, and War will provide an engaging introduction to the genre and craft of historical fiction. You will learn about some of the classics in the genre while encountering five established and emerging authors of historical fiction (including a Pulitzer Prize winner and several New York Times bestsellers) who will be visiting our class as guest writers.

In Parts 1 and 3, I&#39;ll introduce the genre to you, and we&#39;ll read together from a number of classic historical novels from England and the US: Scott’s Waverley (often described as the first historical novel), Charles Dickens’s A Tale of Two Cities (set in Paris and London during the French Revolution), William Wells Brown’s Clotel (the first novel in the African American literary tradition, set in part around the time of Thomas Jefferson), and several others. Given the length and complexity of these novels, lectures will cover selected excerpts only while providing an overview of the development of historical fiction during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. We&#39;ll then move into the twentieth century, with lectures on modernism, metafiction, the mass market, and the New Historical Novel of Latin America. You should think of these parts of the course as providing a kind of toolkit for your future reading in the genre. What motivates certain writers to turn to particular historical moments, and what do they hope to find there? What creative challenges do historical settings and personages present to authors seeking to reimagine the past in fictional narrative?

Guided by similar questions, Parts 2 and 4-7 of the course will consist of a series of seminars on the craft of historical fiction. These seminars will feature five novelists who will be our guests for recorded workshop and discussion sessions as well as on-line forums and chats with Coursera students. We are lucky to have an extraordinary line-up of guest artists whose novels bring to life an array of past cultures, from ancient Rome to Renaissance England to nineteenth-century Malaysia. We will read selections from these authors’ novels along with some of the original historical sources that inspired their fiction. During these sessions our guests will discuss the process of research, the crafting of character, setting, and dialogue, and the challenges of historical fiction as a genre, among other topics. (See below for the list of guest writers.) 

Along with these introductions to the genre and craft of historical fiction, you will have a chance to research and, if you wish, begin crafting your own historical fiction. All students will be assigned to identify either a local archive in their immediate geographical area or a virtual archive on line. This archival component of the course, which you’ll be encouraged to share in the forums, on the course Facebook page, and over our Twitter stream, will expose you to a wealth of historical materials inspiring your peers around the world. For those wishing to attempt writing historical fiction themselves, an optional, ungraded assignment will allow you to post a brief piece of creative work to be read and commented upon by your fellow students. 

Historical fiction immerses us in the past in new and unexpected ways, even while teaching us much about the present. I hope you’ll join me as we explore this immensely rewarding genre and learn from some of its most talented contemporary practitioners.

Here are our visiting writers, with links to their books and home pages:

Jane Alison, Professor of Creative Writing at the University of Virginia, is the author of three novels (including The Marriage of the Sea, a New York Times Notable Book for 2003) as well as a memoir, The Sisters Antipodes. We will be reading from her first novel, The Love Artist, featuring the poet Ovid and his mysterious exile from Rome to the shores of the Black Sea.

Geraldine Brooks, an internationally bestselling novelist whose works have been translated into dozens of languages, received the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 2006 for her novel March. She will visit our class to discuss Year of Wonders, which recreates a mountain village beset by plague in seventeenth-century England.

Yangsze Choo is the debut author of The Ghost Bride, a Fall 2013 selection in Barnes &amp; Noble’s Discover Great New Writers series. The novel, set in colonial Malaysia in the 1890s, explores the Chinese world of spiritual marriage through the eyes of a young woman faced with dark secrets and an impossible choice.

Katherine Howe is a New York Times-bestselling novelist as well as a scholar and teacher of American culture. She will join us to discuss The Physick Book of Deliverance Dane, which tells a transhistorical tale of witchcraft, magic, and persecution from the seventeenth century to the present.

Mary Beth Keane, author of The Walking People, received her MFA from the University of Virginia and in 2011 was named one of the 5 Under 25 by the National Book Foundation. Her novel Fever retells the story of “Typhoid Mary”: Mary Mallon, an Irish immigrant identified as the first immune carrier of typhoid fever in America.

FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?  Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment bearing the instructor&#39;s signature.

Learn about the early days of rock music, from the pre-rock years of the post World War II era through the birth of rock in the mid 1950s to the psychedelic era of the late 1960s.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This course, part 1 of a 2-course sequence, examines the history of rock, primarily as it unfolded in the United States, from the days before rock (pre-1955) to the end of the 1960s. This course covers the music of Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, Phil Spector, Bob Dylan, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix, Cream, and many more artists, with an emphasis both on cultural context and on the music itself. We will also explore how developments in the music business and in technology helped shape the ways in which styles developed. 

Rock emerged in the mid 1950s as a blending of mainstream pop, rhythm and blues, and country and western--styles that previously had remained relatively separate. This new style became the music of the emerging youth culture and was often associated with teen rebellion. We will follow the story of how this rowdy first wave of rock and roll (1955-59) was tamed in the early 60s but came roaring back with the Beatles and the Rolling Stones and then went psychedelic by the end of the decade.

Recommended Background
No previous training in music is required.
Suggested Readings
Although the lectures are designed to be self-contained, we recommend (but do not require) that students refer to the book, What&#39;s That Sound? An Introduction to Rock and Its History (Third Edition), which is the basis for this course. The book contains a more detailed treatment of all the topics discussed in the videos and its structure parallels that of the course. The book also includes dozens of listening guides. The publisher (W.W. Norton) has made an online version of the text available to Coursera students with added features. Extra assignments for those using the book are given in brackets in the Course Syllabus.

Unfortunately, the expense of licensing music to support a course like this is prohibitive. Students are therefore asked to seek out the music discussed here (most of which is readily available on the internet). Because artists cannot be paid otherwise, we encourage all students to purchase the music they enjoy when possible; a playlist of listening guides presented in the textbook is available through iTunes.
Course Format
The class will consist of lecture videos, which are between 8 and 12 minutes in length. These contain 1-2 integrated quiz questions per video. There will be quizzes for each chapter and a final exam.
FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.

What resources will I need for this class?
For this course, all you need is an Internet connection, the textbook (if you decide to use it) and the time to read it, an eagerness to seek out and listen to the music, and the desire to discuss the music and the issues it raises.

What is the coolest thing I&#39;ll learn if I take this class?
You probably will know a fair amount of rock music when you begin the course, but you&#39;ll know a lot more more when you finish it. You may be surprised how much of this new music you will like, even if you initially thought you might not. You&#39;ll also gain a deeper and broader sense of context in which to enjoy your favorite rock music. A course that helps you enjoy your favorite music even more--how can you beat that?!</field>

	<field name="course_body">About the Course

This course covers the music of Led Zeppelin, the Allman Brothers, Carole King, Bob Marley, the Sex Pistols, Donna Summer, Michael Jackson, Madonna, Prince, Metallica, Run-DMC, and Nirvana, and many more artists, with an emphasis both on cultural context and on the music itself. We will also explore how developments in the music business and in technology helped shape the ways in which styles developed. 

Emerging out of the experimental and ambitious years of late-60s psychedelia, rock splintered into a variety of styles in the 1970s as the music business continued to expand. By the end of the decade, punk and disco had challenged the excesses of the hippie aesthetic, as rock became more commercially streamlined and radio friendly. The emergence and rise of MTV transformed pop music and propelled the careers of Michael jackson and Madonna, while heavy metal and hip hop dominated the late 1980s. Nirvana leads alt-rock&#39;s return to simplicity in the early 1990s.

This history course explores how fundamental changes in film technology affected popular Hollywood storytelling. We will consider the transition to sound, and the introduction of color. Each change in technology brought new opportunities and challenges, but the filmmaker&#39;s basic task remained the emotional engagement of the viewer through visual means. We will survey major directors and genres from the studio era and point forward to contemporary American cinema. Our aim is to illuminate popular cinema as the intersection of business, technology, and art. Through film history, we will learn about the craft of filmmaking and how tools shape art. This online educational experience is not equivalent to a college course.

This course focuses on the destruction of Jews in Europe by Nazi Germany, but the true scope of the course is much broader; exploring also the shifting historical conditions from which the Holocaust emerged. Students will explore memoirs, historical documents, poetry, documentary footage, filmic representations, novels, and other media that help to illustrate the multiplicity and variety of human experience during this important historical episode.

By the end of the course, you will have an expanded knowledge and understanding of Eastern and Western Jewish communities, the origins and development of antisemitism, the formation and operation of concentration camps, the resistance movements, and the Holocaust as a problem for world-history. Additionally, you will have engaged with the problematics of representation, memory, &quot;the memorial&quot;, and witnessing.

This course is supported by the Neufeld-Levin Chair in Holocaust studies.

An introduction to physics in the context of everyday objects.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Designed for non-science students, this course is a practical introduction to physics and science in everyday life. It considers objects from the world around us, identifying and exploring the scientific concepts upon which they&#39;re based. Because it starts with objects and looks within them for science, it is the reverse of a traditional physics class. Instead of the usual principle-driven physics class, How Things Work is case-study physics. In this pilot semester of How Things Work, we will explore the basic laws of motion in the context of six familiar objects or activities: (1) Skating, (2) Falling Balls, (3) Ramps, (4) Seesaws, (5) Wheels, and (6) Bumper Cars. Despite their simplicity, these topics will bring us in contact with some of the most important concepts in physics, including inertia, energy, and momentum.
Course Syllabus
Episode 1 – Skating

   Inertia and why skaters coast.

Episode 2 – Falling Balls

   Weight and why balls fall after being dropped or thrown.

Episode 3 – Ramps

   Energy and why it&#39;s easier to push a piano up a ramp than to lift it up a ladder.

Episode 4 – Seesaws

   Rotation and how different children can balance a seesaw and rock it back and forth.

Episode 5 – Wheels

   Friction and how wheels deal with friction to let vehicles coast or propel them forward.

Episode 6 – Bumper Cars

   Momentum and angular momentum, and how those quantities influence the collisions between bumper cars.

Recommended Background
None.
Suggested Readings
Physics is not easy and learning its concepts requires repeated exposure to them. In addition to watching the videos, I encourage you to read my textbook: How Things Work 5th Edition by Louis A Bloomfield (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2013). This class will cover the first two chapters of the book, with each episode corresponding to a section in one of those chapters.

You can obtain How Things Work, 5th Edition from Wiley (www.wiley.com) or any online bookstore, including Amazon:

How Things Work: The Physics of Everyday Life, 5th Edition  

How Things Work: The Physics of Everyday Life, 5th Edition (Kindle)  

I have also created a version of this material for a general readership (not a textbook): How Everything Works by Louis A Bloomfield (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008): 
How Everything Works: Making Physics Out of the Ordinary  

Course Format
The course consists of six episodes, one for each of the six objects or activities. Each episode consists of six to eight short video segments and a quiz (homework assignment), along with suggested readings in the optional textbook. All of the episodes will become available at the start of the course, but a suggested pace is one episode per week. 

The first video segment in an episode introduces the episode&#39;s topic and identifies some of the physics issues that we will need to examine in order to understand how the topic works. It also poses five or six how or why questions, each of which is subsequently addressed in its own video segment. The final video segment in the episode summarizes the physics concepts encountered during the episode while explaining how the topic works.

Each of the middle video segments, those that address how or why questions, also asks you one or two questions of its own. Though technically optional, these in-video quiz questions are intended to be thought-provoking and to help you solidify your understanding of key physics concepts as we encounter them. I hope that you will answer those questions and use them to help you learn physics.

The episode&#39;s homework assignment asks you to apply the physics concepts encountered in the episode&#39;s videos (and suggested reading) to other real-world contexts. The questions are multiple-choice and rarely require calculations. In my experience, the physics concepts themselves are already challenging to learn and apply, and trying to perform calculations using their more formulaic aspects is a distraction, rather than a worthwhile activity. You may attempt each homework assignment as many times as you like. Struggling with challenging questions is one of the best ways to learn physics.</field>

Introduction to the science of human origins, the fossil and archaeological record, and genetic ancestry of living and ancient human populations. The course emphasizes the ways our evolution touches our lives, including health and diet, and explores how deep history may shape the future of our species.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This course covers our evolutionary history across more than seven million years, from our origins among the apes up to the biological changes that are still unfolding today. If you enroll, you&#39;ll encounter the evidence for the earliest members of our lineage, as they begin the long pathway to humanity. You&#39;ll see how scientists are learning about the diets of ancient people, using microscopic evidence and chemical signatures in ancient teeth. We will explore together the exciting fossil discoveries of the last ten years, which have shaken up our notions of the origin of human culture and our own genus. 

Genomics has fundamentally transformed the way we understand our evolution, in many ways opening the direct evidence of our history to anyone. The course will teach you how to look inside the genomes of humans, Neandertals and other ancient people.  If you have used personal genomics to get your own genotypes, the course will guide you in connecting genetics to your ancestry among ancient humans.

The course brings a special focus on the rapid evolutionary changes of the last 10,000 years. You&#39;ll learn about the consequences of our shift to agriculture, and the ways that people of industrialized nations are still changing today. At the end, we trek forward to anticipate what evolutionary changes may be in store for humanity in the future, using our knowledge of history and scientific understanding to inform our speculations.
Recommended Background
All are welcome to participate and view materials, which assume no special background. To complete some exercises, a basic knowledge of high school-level biology and algebra will be necessary.
Course Format
The materials are designed to guide students on their own distinctive paths of discovery. Short documentary videos highlight the most up-to-date science and bring students virtually into some of the most famous archaeological sites. With a series of interviews, students will hear about new ideas from many of the world&#39;s leading experts. A series of activities give students an opportunity to see their measurements next to those provided by the worldwide group of students. Students can dig deeper by investigating ways that humanity may evolve into the future.

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
About 2 million years ago our human ancestors were insignificant animals living in a corner of Africa. Their impact on the world was no greater than that of gorillas, zebras, or chickens. Today humans are spread all over the world, and they are the most important animal around. The very future of life on Earth depends on the ideas and behavior of our species.

This course will explain how we humans have conquered planet Earth, and how we have changed our environment, our societies, and our own bodies and minds. The aim of the course is to give students a brief but complete overview of history, and to answer some basic historical questions such as:

            What is religion?

            What is an empire?

            What is money?

            What is science?

            What is capitalism?      

            Why did almost all societies believe that women are inferior to men?

            Does history have a direction? 

            Did people become happier as history progressed?

            And what is the likely future of humankind? 

Course Syllabus
Part I: The Cognitive Revolution

 

Lecture 1: The Human Family

One hundred thousand years ago, at least six different species of humans inhabited planet Earth. Our species, Homo sapiens, was just one among them. Who were the others? Where did they come from? And what happened to them? Why is there today only one species of humans—Homo sapiens?

 

Lecture 2: The Cognitive Revolution

The Cognitive Revolution, about 70,000 years ago, enabled Homo sapiens to conquer the world and drive all other human species to extinction. During this revolution, Homo sapiens developed a new and remarkable kind of language. How was this language different from the languages of earlier human species and of other animals? What were the advantages that Homo sapiens gained from this unique language?

 

Lecture 3: Daily Life in the Stone Age

What was life like for people who lived 30,000 years ago? What did they do when they woke up in the morning? How did they organize their societies? Did they have monogamous relationships and nuclear families? Did they have religions, revolutions, and wars?

 

Lecture 4: The Human Flood

Following the Cognitive Revolution, Homo sapiens spread all over the planet. While doing this, it drove numerous other species to extinction. In Australia, up to 95% of all large animal species vanished. In America, 84 of 107 large mammal species disappeared. Altogether, about half of the large terrestrial mammals that populated Earth became extinct. How could a few million individuals who possessed no more than Stone Age technology have caused such devastation?

 

 

Part II: The Agricultural Revolution

 

Lecture 5: History’s Biggest Fraud

About 12,000 years ago, people in the Middle East, China, and Central America began domesticating plants and animals. In the process, Homo sapiens, too, was domesticated, abandoning a life of hunting and gathering for the pleasures and discomforts of agriculture. For most people, the discomforts outweighed the pleasures. The Agricultural Revolution made the life of the average person harder. Why, then, did it occur?

 

Lecture 6: Building Pyramids

For millions of years, humans lived in intimate bands of no more than a few dozen individuals. Our biological instincts are adapted to this way of life. Humans are consequently ill-equipped to cooperate with large numbers of strangers. Yet shortly after the Agricultural Revolution erupted, humans established cities, kingdoms, and huge empires. How did they do it? How can millions of strangers agree on shared laws, norms and values?

 

Lecture 7: There is No Justice in History

A critical factor in the formation of complex societies was the division of the population into a hierarchy of groups. Agricultural and industrial societies have been built on hierarchies of class, race, ethnicity, and gender. Why was it impossible to create a just and equal society? What is the deep root of prejudice and injustice? In particular, why did almost all known societies treat men as superior to women?

 

 

Part III: The Unification of Humankind

 

Lecture 8: The Direction of History

After the Agricultural Revolution, humans created many different cultures and societies. The relations between these different societies were very complex, and involved wars and conflicts as well as trade, immigration and imitation. But as time went by, the connections between the societies became stronger and stronger, so that humankind was gradually united into a single global society. Three main forces shaped this process of unification. The first was money and trade. Money is the most universal system of mutual trust ever devised by humans. How come even people who believe in different gods and obey rival kings, are nevertheless willing to use the same money?

 

Lecture 9: Imperial Visions

The second force that shaped the process of human unification is imperialism. The idea of empire is seen today in a very negative light, but empires have played such a central role in human history that it’s hard to regard them as totally evil. What exactly is an empire? How have empires succeeded in uniting under their control different ecological regions, ethnic groups, and religious communities? How can we balance the positive contribution of empires with their record of violence and oppression? And what is the future of the imperial ideal? Is the world destined to be ruled by a new global empire?

 

Lecture 10: The Law of Religion

The third force that shaped the process of human unification is religion. The role of religion in history is extremely controversial. Some see religion as the root of all evil, while for others it is the primary source of happiness, empathy, and progress. Can we arrive at a balanced judgment? What were the main landmarks in the religious history of the world? In what ways did different cultures understand the universe, distinguish good from evil, and explain the ubiquitous presence of suffering?

 

 

Part IV. The Scientific Revolution

 

Lecture 11: The Discovery of Ignorance

During the last 500 years the process of human unification was completed. At the same time, there has been an explosive growth in the power of humankind, due above all to the discoveries of modern science. Humankind has become increasingly convinced that the only thing that limits its power is its own ignorance, and that the discovery of new knowledge can enable it to do almost anything. How is the modern scientific tradition different from all previous traditions of knowledge? What accounts for its sudden rise and for its unparalleled achievements?

 

Lecture 12: The Marriage of Science and Empire

Modern science developed in alliance with the modern European empires. The conquest of new knowledge depended upon and made possible the conquest of new territories. What exactly was the contribution of science to the rise of the European empires, and what was the contribution of the European empires to the development of science? And why did it all start in Europe, rather than in China, India, or the Middle East?

 

Lecture 13: The Capitalist Creed

The close ties between science and imperialism were in fact just one part of a more complex relationship. The third crucial member of this relationship was capitalism, which financed both science and empire, and which led to an unprecedented growth in the world economy. How does a capitalist economy function? How is it different from traditional economies? Is capitalism natural, or is it really a kind of religion?

 

Lecture 14: The Industrial Revolution

During the last 200 years, the combination of science, imperialism and capitalism produced the Industrial Revolution. This revolution gave humankind control of enormous new energy resources, and enabled humankind to start manufacturing far more things than ever before, far more quickly, and far more cheaply. How did this change the global ecology, daily life, and human psychology?

 

Lecture 15: A Permanent Revolution

The Industrial Revolution opened an era of permanent revolution. The late modern socio-political order is constantly changing, never settling into any stable pattern. The pillars of human order—most notably, the family and the intimate community—are crumbling around us. How do humans deal with the resulting vacuum and chaos? How do society and politics function without stability? Is the world becoming more violent and dangerous, or is it actually more peaceful and secure than ever before?

 

Lecture 16: And They Lived Happily Ever After

Have 500 years of amazing discoveries, developments, and revolutions made people happier? Are people today happier than in the Middle Ages, or in the Stone Age? If not, what was the point of all these changes? Most history books ignore these issues, yet these are the most important questions we can ask about history. New studies in biology, economics, and psychology are offering fascinating insights into the history of human happiness.

 

Lecture 17: The End of Homo Sapiens

Over the last few decades humans have began to bend and break the laws of natural selection—laws that have governed life on Earth for the past four billion years. New technologies such as genetic engineering and nanotechnology are giving us unprecedented abilities to design not only the world around us, but also our own bodies, our personalities, and our desires. How will this influence society and culture? Does anybody know where we are heading? What is the likely future of humankind?

Learn about the ethical issues that arise when conducting human subjects research, as well as the history that grounds policies and debates in this area of biomedicine.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
The objective of this course is to increase participants’ awareness and understanding of ethical issues that arise in the conduct of research on human subjects. The course will explore the history and future of ethical and policy challenges using a multi-disciplinary approach. Leading scholars in the ethics of human subject research will serve as course faculty.  This course will introduce participants to the history that grounds policies and debates regarding the use of humans in research. It will continue with discussion of how current international and US policies governing research are applied, how ethical norms and concepts have evolved, and how, in some cases, changes in research have outpaced changes in policy, leading to an often complicated mismatch between the two. 

The lead instructor is Jeffrey Kahn, who is the Robert Henry Levi and Ryda Hecht Levi Professor of Bioethics and Public Policy at the Johns Hopkins University Berman Institute of Bioethics.  He will be joined by colleagues who are all among the leading scholars in aspects of the ethical and policy issues related to research on human subjects, including Profs. Ruth Faden (history and theory of informed consent), Nancy Kass (public health research, research in international settings), Jeremy Sugarman (empirical approaches to research ethics, US research policy), Debra Mathews (US and international science and research policy), Gail Geller (participants&#39; perspectives on research participation), Joseph Ali (law and research oversight in US and international settings), and Dan O&#39;Connor (medical history, ethics and social media-based research).

Preview Lectures</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This course examines key computational abstraction levels below modern high-level languages; number representation, assembly language, introduction to C, memory management, the operating-system process model, high-level machine architecture including the memory hierarchy, and how high-level languages are implemented. We will develop students’ sense of “what really happens” when software runs — and that this question can be answered at several levels of abstraction, including the hardware architecture level, the assembly level, the C programming level and the Java programming level. The core around which the course is built is C, assembly, and low-level data representation, but this is connected to higher levels (roughly how basic Java could be implemented), lower levels (the general structure of a processor and the memory hierarchy), and the role of the operating system (but not how the operating system is implemented).
Course Syllabus
This course should develop students’ sense of “what really happens” when software runs — and convey that this question can be answered at several levels of abstraction, including the hardware architecture level, the assembly level, the C programming level and the Java programming level. The core around which the course is built is C, assembly, and low-level data representation, but this is connected to higher levels (roughly how basic Java could be implemented), lower levels (the general structure of a processor), and the role of the operating system (but not how the operating system is implemented). For (computer science) students wanting to specialize at higher levels of abstraction, this could in the extreme be the only course they take that considers the “C level” and below. However, most will take a subset of Systems Programming, Hardware Design and Implementation, Operating Systems, Compilers, etc. For students interested in hardware, embedded systems, computer engineering, computer architecture, etc., this course is the introductory course after which other courses will delve both deeper (into specific topics) and lower (into hardware implementation, circuit design, etc.). The course has three principal themes:
Representation: how different data types (from simple integers to arrays of data structures) are represented in memory, how instructions are encoded, and how memory addresses (pointers) are generated and used to create complex structures.
Translation: how high-level languages are translated into the basic instructions embodied in process hardware with a particular focus on C and Java.
Control flow: how computers organize the order of their computations, keep track of where they are in large programs, and provide the illusion of multiple processes executing in parallel.
At the end of this course, students should:
understand the multi-step process by which a high-level program becomes a stream of instructions executed by a processor;
know what a pointer is and how to use it in manipulating complex data structures;
be facile enough with assembly programming (X86) to write simple pieces of code and understand how it maps to high-level languages (and vice-versa);
understand the basic organization and parameters of memory hierarchy and its importance for system performance;
be able to explain the role of an operating system;
know how Java fundamentally differs from C;
grasp what parallelism is and why it is important at the system level; and
be more effective programmers (more efficient at finding bugs, improved intuition about system performance).
Topics: 
Number representation
Assembly language
Basics of C
Memory management
Operating-system process model
High-level machine architecture
Memory hierarchy
Implementation of high-level languages
Recommended Background
Introductory programming in C or Java.

Why and how are teachers integrating ICT (Information and Communication Technology) into primary education? In this course we analyse examples from schools in different parts of the world, and bring professional teachers, headteachers and policymakers together to share their best ideas and inspiring stories. The materials in the course are based on studies carried out for the UNESCO Institute of IT in Education, Moscow.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Teachers and policymakers working in all sectors of education now recognise the importance and value of technology for learning and teaching. The Institute of Education, University of London (IOE http://www.ioe.ac.uk/ ) and the UNESCO Institute for IT in Education (IITE http://iite.unesco.org/ ) are collaborating to run this professional development course for teachers, headteachers and policymakers working in the Primary Education sector.

The course is part of IITE’s role to support and promote an active community of practitioners and policymakers in the use of digital technologies for learning and teaching.

It is also linked to the IOE’s mission to promote excellence in education and professional practice through advancing knowledge and understanding. 

The resources for the course are derived from teachers’ Primary practice in different countries. The UNESCO IITE funded an international project to collect practices, experiences, policies, cases and data from several countries in different parts of the world. The outcome is two volumes summarising the findings. The basis of the course is therefore not a particular theoretical approach, but a collection of good and interesting experiences and exemplars of ICT in primary education from across the world. What unites all the authors and teachers involved in the project is our conviction that ICT, used well, by good teachers, alongside other methods, can enable every child to achieve their learning potential.

Recommended Background
The course is intended as a professional development course for primary education leaders, teachers and policymakers in all countries.

Our aim is to engage teachers, school leaders, and policymakers, across the world, in continually improving the quality and reach of primary education by optimising the use of the digital technologies available to teachers, learners, and their families.

Course Format
The course resources will include video materials and photos from schools, interviews with key teachers and policymakers from different countries, pdfs of materials from relevant UNESCO IITE books, case studies of approaches to integrating ICT, examples of pupils’ work with ICT, pdfs of articles and reports.

A weekly discussion forum will be organised around 3 key questions, updated each week.  We will create topic issues for group discussions and exchanges.

Examples are:

Involving parents
Special needs
Engaging colleagues.
Participants in the course will be invited to maintain a reflective blog of their reactions to the content presented, and to illustrate their own practices with photos, videos or links to an online resource or site.

The course is designed so that the core materials and assessed activities can all be completed within 4 hours per week for participants with the equivalent of IELTS Level 6 for English. A further 6 hours of materials and optional activities will also be available, thus supporting a total of around 10 hours per week of study time. Naturally, these figures are approximate, given that participants may decide how much time and effort they spend on each activity. 

FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this course?

Yes. The course offers a Statement of Accomplishment in the form of a certificate from Coursera to all participants who complete all the contribution activities. These take the form of, for example, comments on the resources, contributions to discussions, examples of participants’ own practice.

In this class you will look behind the scenes of image and video processing, from the basic and classical tools to the most modern and advanced algorithms.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
What is image and video processing? Images and videos are everywhere, from those we take with our mobile devices and share with our friends to those that we receive from Mars and the ones we see in the movie theatre, without forgetting the whole ensemble of images of our bodies that are taken in hospital visits. Image and video processing is the art of working with such images and movies, from making it possible to store and transmit them to making those dark and blurry images look nice, as well as interpreting and analyzing the medical data and recognizing our friends’ faces in social pictures. This discipline is also fascinating because it uses tools from many areas of applied mathematics. In this class you will look behind the scenes of image and video processing, from the basic and classical tools to the most modern and advanced algorithms.

The course will start with an introduction to the basics of image formation and the fundamental concepts that translate a physical scene into a digital image. We will then describe the underlying concepts of image compression, the enabling technology that makes it possible for images to be sent from Mars and videos to be stored in our mobile phones. We will cover the most fundamental tools in image enhancement, showing how simple tools can significantly improve images. Both geometric and non-geometric tools as well as spatial and non-spatial operations will be presented. Details on image segmentation will be provided, one of the most fundamental and useful problems in image processing. The above topics will be extended to color images and video. Once we have covered the fundamentals, which both provide the basis for modern image and video processing and serve many important applications until today, we will move into recent progress in the area, covering image inpainting (how to remove objects from images and video), image processing via sparse modeling and compressed sensing, geometric partial differential equations for image analysis, image processing for HIV and virus research, and image processing for neurosurgery and other medical applications.
Course Syllabus
Week 1- Introduction to Image and Video Processing: We will cover the fundamentals, including some elements of visual perception, sensing, sampling, and quantization.

Week 2- Image and Video Compression: We will learn the fundamental tools enabling us to receive images from Mars, to upload images to the web, and to store a lot of images and videos in our mobile phones.

Week 3- Spatial Processing: This week we will learn some of the most classical and fundamental tools that help us still today to make noisy, blurry, and dark images look much better.

Week 4- Image Restoration: When something is known or estimated about the degradation process, we can do much better, and in this week we will learn how.

Week 5- Image Segmentation: How do we split an image or video in its core components?

Week 6- Geometric PDEs: We will learn about the use of partial differential equations and geometric deformations for problems like image enhancement and object detection.

Week 7- Image and Video Inpainting: How to make objects disappear and other special effects.

Week 8- Sparse Modeling and Compressed Sensing: We will cover some of the most modern tools for image enhancement and image analysis.

Week 9- Medical Imaging: As an example of medical image analysis, we will illustrate examples and techniques in the areas of brain research and virus analysis.

Computer Exercises- See below for more details on this.
Recommended Background
Image and video analysis can be approached from numerous areas of mathematics, from linear algebra to geometry, optimization, and differential equations. We plan to make all the lectures as self-contained as possible, but basic background in linear algebra and digital signal processing will be helpful.
Suggested Readings
The first 5 lectures will follow, in part, &quot;Digital Image Processing, 3rd edition&quot; by Gonzalez and Woods. The more advanced material will be based on material the instructor will make available. Some interesting books for the advanced material include:

Michael Elad, Sparse and Redundant Representations: From Theory to Applications in Signal and Image Processing, Springer.

Guillermo Sapiro, Geometric Partial Differential Equations in Image Analysis, Cambridge University Press.

Alex Bronstein, Michael Bronstein, and Ron Kimmel, Numerical Geometry of Non-Rigid Shapes, Springer 

One of the first and still outstanding books in digital image processing is: Azriel Rosenfeld and Avinash Kak, Digital Picture Processing, Academic Press.
Course Format
The class will consist of lecture videos, normally less then 15 minutes in length. Several such segments will constitute a weekly class. Weekly homework/quizzes will help students to stay on track. There will also be frequently assigned optional programming projects to help students experience the practice of image and video analysis. Weekly subjects will stay as self-contained as possible, starting every week with a new topic in the rich area of image and video analysis.


Computer Exercises

We will have numerous optional computer exercises, with forums and teaching assistants dedicated to them. This in addition to students, which in the past have produced outstanding codes and helped each other tremendously.

MathWorks (http://www.mathworks.com/) will provide free Matlab (with the necessary toolboxes) for those students registered to the class and that are interested in using Matlab for their optional homework. Tutorials will be provided to help those that need to learn the language.

FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.

What resources will I need for this class?
The main resource needed for this class is curiosity and an appetite for learning a new topic. For those interested in pursuing some of the projects, having Matlab (with their own license) and the image processing toolbox will be very useful. However, the same projects could be performed in other programming environments available to the students.

What are the coolest things I&#39;ll learn if I take this class?
How to make objects disappear in images and videos, how to see the shape of viruses, how to analyze the inside of your brain, and how we can store so many images and videos in our mobile phones.</field>

What does it mean for an immigrant to become a U.S. citizen? Through a background of historical and policy perspectives, this course will examine U.S. law governing how citizenship is acquired, the constitutional and international law foundations underlying immigration regulation, the role of the federal government in regulating immigration, and immigration law reform.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This course analyzes the historical origins of citizenship and immigration in the United States and provides an overview of modern U.S. law.  Beyond traditional notions of “law,” the course also includes significant elements of immigration policy, social science, history, political theory, and ethics.  One goal of the course is to provide a basic knowledge base for students to make and influence law and policy in immigration and citizenship.

Among the questions the course will explore:

How is U.S. citizenship acquired?  Can it be lost?
What is the origin and significance of the U.S. practice of awarding citizenship to anyone born here?
Who decides who can enter the country, and who must leave?
What rights do non-citizens have?  What about those who have entered the country illegally?
What is most needed for immigration reform in the US?
Course Syllabus
Week 1: Citizenship
Citizenship is the most basic distinction among persons currently living in or seeking to enter the United States, and thus we begin the course with this legal status. Topics covered this week include how one becomes a U.S. citizen, how citizenship at birth is determined in this and other countries, the concept of &quot;dual citizenship,&quot; and how citizenship might be lost. What rights come with citizenship? What are the reasons for becoming a U.S. citizen if a non-citizen is a lawful permanent resident?

From Non-Citizen to Citizen: The Naturalization Process
Citizenship at Birth: Jus Soli and Jus Sanguinis
The Fourteenth Amendment&#39;s Birthright Citizenship Clause
Status of Persons Born in U.S. Territories and Possessions
Rights and Responsibilities of U.S. Citizens
Proof of Citizenship; Dual Nationality; Loss of Citizenship
U.S. Citizenship for Sale? (optional lecture)
Week 2: History of U.S. Immigration
Having considered the legal distinction between citizens and non-citizens in week one, we now turn to immigration into the United States, the first step toward attaining citizenship. Laws governing who may enter the country, the conditions of entry, and actions that may result in deportation will occupy the remainder of the course. This week we examine the history of U.S. immigration. Beginning with the Chinese Exclusion Acts in the 1880&#39;s, U.S. law has at times discriminated against specific racial and ethnic groups. Ironically, the most important constitutional law doctrines governing U.S. immigration law solidified during those eras. The modern constitutional doctrine of &quot;plenary power&quot; is introduced here.

Myths and Realities of an &quot;Open Border&quot; Past
The Chinese Exclusion Acts and the U.S. Supreme Court
The &quot;Plenary Power&quot; Doctrine in U.S. Constitutional Law
Modern Structure: Federal Agencies and Courts
The Faces of Immigration Today: Numbers
Week 3: Eligibility for Immigration, Part I
This week we will consider the requirements for legal immigration to the U.S. These come in the form of general criteria applicable to all who seek to enter (e.g., no criminal history, not likely to become a &quot;public charge&quot;), as well as specific requirements for an entry visa and the &quot;green card&quot; -- permission to remain in the United States indefinitely as a lawful permanent resident.

Requirements for Entry:  Introduction to the Grounds of Inadmissibility
Inadmissibility Based on Immigration Control
Inadmissibility Based on National Security
Inadmissibility Based on Criminal Acts
Inadmissibility Based on Public Health
Inadmissibility on Economic Grounds
Procedures to Determine Admissibility
Week 4: Eligibility for Immigration, Part II
Week four continues our examination of eligibility for non-U.S. citizens to enter or remain in the country. This week focuses more closely on categories of immigrants -- guest workers, business employees, and family members, as well as temporary visitors such as students and tourists. Along with border security, these visa categories are at the center of current debates over immigration reform, given that the waiting time for some persons eligible to immigrate to the United States can reach decades. Recent proposals for immigration reform are noted here.

The &quot;Green Card&quot; and a Broken Immigration System
Permanent Residency through Family Relationship
Citizenship through Marriage and the Marriage Fraud Act
Immigration through Employment
Refugees and Asylum
U.S. Immigration Reform
Week 5: Breaking the Rules: Deportation Proceedings and Border Security
Our concluding week focuses upon the various grounds for deportation, deportation proceedings, and a brief overview of the U.S. immigration court system. Border security measures seek to protect the nation&#39;s security as well as public health and safety. Of particular interest is the &quot;extended border control&quot; capability of the Department of Homeland Security. Enhanced border security is one key to political compromise on immigration reform, providing a final opportunity in this course to consider the future direction of immigration law in the United States.</field>

Learn the basic concepts of improvisation from Gary Burton, one of the most renowned improvisers in the jazz world, including the mental, melodic, and harmonic processes that contribute to the instinctive skills that an improviser puts to use when taking a solo.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
While many people are fans of jazz and understand that musicians are often “making up” the notes they are playing during a performance, most people—often including musicians, themselves, who are beginning to learn improvising—aren’t clear about what exact processes take place to enable this to happen. The purpose of this course is to introduce the basic concepts of modern improvisation and how to go about mastering the different musical and mental skills involved. 

Course author Gary Burton codifies a sought-after approach to improvisation that has been at the core of Berklee College of Music&#39;s curriculum for decades. Students who complete this course will know what to practice and how to practice the various aspects of improvising, in addition to understanding how the improviser spontaneously communicates to the listeners through their musical creations. 
Course Syllabus
Lesson 1: Improvisation as a Language
This lesson explores how improvisation uses our language abilities to construct logical melodic phrases. It introduces the concept of musical speech with vocabulary and grammar, when applied to improvisation.
Lesson 2: The Improviser’s Vocabulary

This lesson examines the use of chord outlines. It identifies the most commonly occurring chord scales and how to practice them in order to assimilate them.
Lesson 3: Making Scale Choices in Real Time

This lesson introduces a set of guidelines for determining the correct choices for scales in various harmonic situations.
Lesson 4: Harmony for the Improviser

In this lesson, you will learn about the different types of harmony movement and resolution, and how the improviser uses them when playing through the different types of chord progressions. 
Lesson 5: Theme and Variation

In this lesson, you will learn about theme development and establishing continuity of melodic phrases and ideas to build musical story lines  as a basis for improvisations.





Recommended Background
You should have at least an intermediate level of playing ability on your instrument, basic note reading experience, a knowledge of chord symbols (C7, Gm7, F7b9, Abm7, for example) and should, at a minimum, have tried improvising on some basic songs such as 12-bar blues or some familiar standard tunes. 
Course Format
The course consists of video demonstrations, with integrated quizzes that allow you to reinforce your knowledge of the material before moving on. You will also have assignments that ask you to submit recorded examples of your playing for peer review.
FAQ
What do I need in order to record my assignments?
During the course, you will be asked to submit recorded examples of your playing. In order to do this, you will need your computer&#39;s built-in microphone or an external microphone plugged directly into your computer (via built-in ports or an external audio interface), in addition to basic audio recording software, such as Audacity, that will allow you to record yourself playing and save the recording in MP3 format.</field>

Learn how debt and equity can be used to finance infrastructure investments and how investors approach infrastructure investments.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
According to the OECD, the total global infrastructure investment requirement by 2030 for transport, electricity generation, transmission and distribution, water and telecommunications comes to $71tn. This figure represents about 3.5% of the annual World GDP from 2007 to 2030.

The European Commission estimated that, by 2020, Europe will need between euro 1.5tn and euro 2tn of infrastructure investments. In the time period between 2011 and 2020, about euro 500bn will be required for the implementation of the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) programme, euro 400bn for Energy distribution networks and smart grids, euro 200 bn on Energy transmission networks and storage and euro 500bn for the upgrade and construction of new power plants. An additional euro 38-58bn and euro 181-268bn capital investment will be needed to achieve the targets set by the European Commission for broadband diffusion.

Traditionally, investments in infrastructure were financed using public sources. However, severe budget constraints and inefficient management of infrastructure by public entities have led to an increased involvement of private investors in the business. 

The course focuses on how private investors approach infrastructure projects from the standpoints of equity, debt and hybrid instruments. 

The course is concentrated on the practical aspects of project finance, the most frequently used financial technique for infrastructure investments. The repeated use of real life examples and case studies allows students to link the theoretical background to actual business practice.

At the end of the course, students will be in the position to analyze a complex transaction, to identify key elements of the deal and to suggest proper solutions for deal structuring from the perspective of a financial advisor.

Course Syllabus
Week 1: Introduction to project and infrastructure finance; vocabulary of project finance.

Week 2: The syndication process.

Week 3: Risk analysis and risk allocation from the perspective of private investors.

Week 4: Capital budgeting for infrastructure investments.

Week 5: How to assess the financial sustainability of an infrastructure project from the investor&#39;s standpoint.

Week 6: Recent evolutions in the infrastructure finance market.
Recommended Background
No particular background in finance is required, although a basic knowledge of principles of corporate finance is recommended.
Suggested Readings
The course is designed to be self-contained. 

For those students interested in additional study material, we suggest you to refer to:
Gatti Stefano, Project Finance in theory and practice, Academic Press, 2nd edition, 2012.
Course Format

Improve your ability to manage creativity and to lead an innovation strategy in businesses, schools, hospitals, governments, and other complex organizations and institutions, by diagnosing likely innovation failures before they occur.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This course is intended to help you improve your ability to manage creativity, innovation and change in business, education, healthcare, government, and in any other complex organization or institution by diagnosing potential innovation failures before they can occur. Using an “innovation constraints” framework that draws on modern social science research and on insights from business practice, participants will learn how to best manage people (be they co-workers, bosses, customers, clients, friends or any other stakeholders) when innovation is the goal.  While we see several examples of technological innovation, we are not focused on the management of technology.  Instead, we focus on something much more powerful:  understanding and managing the people engaged in creation, innovation and positive change, regardless of the context.
The course is designed to help you answer the following types of questions:

What are the conditions for successful innovation?
What causes innovation to fail?
What makes creative people creative?
How should I manage an innovative team?
How do I lead an effective brainstorm process?
What is an innovation portfolio and how can I manage one?
Why do so many great ideas get killed?
The approach in this class will be to treat innovation as the process of generating, assessing, and then implementing useful and valuable ideas.  As we will discuss, generating ideas is relatively easy; what can be hard is getting those ideas listened to, accepted, and implemented in organizations.  In addition to learning how to lead creative people and creative teams, participants will also learn techniques for improving their own creativity.  During the course you will engage numerous activities and exercises intended to bring current habits of thought and behavior to the surface for examination and change.

Course Syllabus
Week 1:  Introduction:  Why Everyone Wants Innovation but No One Wants to Change
We introduce the approach of the class:  instead of trying to be innovative, just stop stopping it.  We discuss a framework for analyzing the six most common barriers (constraints) that stop innovation.

Week 2:  Individual Constraints:  Why Most of Us Are More Creative Than We Think
Psychologists treat innovation as a problem of having creative ideas; we sometimes stop innovation by not &quot;thinking different&quot;.  This week explores the constraints of perception, intellection, and expression and offers strategies for overcoming them.

Week 3:  Group Constraints:  Why a Brainstorm Meeting Can Be Worse Than No Meeting at All
Social psychologists treat innovation as a group problem:  we often don&#39;t get early support for our ideas because of adverse group dynamics.  This week looks at the constraints of emotion, culture, and process in groups as well as the environment within which groups work, and looks at ways to overcome them.

Week 4:  Organizational Constraints:  Why You’ll Never Be a Prophet in Your Own Hometown
The field of management sees the problem of innovation as one of the organization; organization is the opposite of innovation, after all.  This week explores the constraints of strategy, structure, and resources and we explore ways of framing them that will help us to overcome them.   

 Week 5:  Industry Constraints: If It’s Such a Great Idea, Why Isn’t Our Competitor Doing It?
An economist view of failed innovation sees it as a problem of adoption; when there&#39;s no market to adopt it, it&#39;s not an innovation, it&#39;s just a creative idea.  We look at the constraints of competition, suppliers, and markets and discuss strategies you can use to relax them.

Week 6:  Societal Constraints:  Why My Innovation Means You Have to Change
The sociological and anthropological perspective suggests that societies control or obstruct innovations that are deemed as dangerous or contrary to societal values.  This week explores the constraints of identity, social control, and history and we will seek an understanding of how we might avoid them. 

Week 7:  Technological Constraints:  How to Take a Really Hard Problem and Make It Completely Impossible
Engineers and scientists see failed innovation as a failure of technology; if it doesn&#39;t work, it&#39;s not an innovation.  Here we explore the constraints of knowledge, time, and the natural environment.  Rather than trying to overcome them, we develop strategies for working within these constraints.

Week 8:  When Failure Is Not an Option: Leading an Innovation Strategy
The final week has us putting the entire model together into the leadership context.  We will learn about innovation portfolios and discuss a tested process for moving innovations from ideas to realities.  

This animated video describes the basic issues addressed by the course. 

Recommended Background
Ideally, participants will have had work experience in some type of organization.  Management experience is a plus, but is not required.
Suggested Readings
While I will provide pointers to additional readings for each class module, I recommend (but do not require) that that students refer to the book &quot;Creative People Must Be Stopped!&quot; which was written specifically for this course.
Course Format
The course will consist primarily of weekly video lectures with embedded quizzes, short exercises, readings, several diagnostic surveys, and a brief weekly reflection paper. In addition, and in recognition that not all participants have the same learning objectives or available time, the course is offered at two levels of engagement:
 
&quot;Standard Track&quot;- - Estimated Time Commitment:  4 – 6 Hours Per Week
Students at this level receive a “Statement of Accomplishment” that certifies advanced proficiency with the course concepts and framework.  This track is designed for those who wish to engage the material by doing assignments, exercises and discussion board participation, however, who may not have the time to complete an innovation project.
 
“Studio Mastery Track” - Estimated Time Commitment: 6 – 10 Hours Per Week
Students at this level will receive a “Statement of Accomplishment - With Distinction that certifies mastery of the practice of the course content.  Students will apply the material by completing an innovation project in a small team.  This track is designed for those students wishing to achieve mastery of the course material and to understand its application in a real-world project context. 
FAQ

Can you really teach people how to be creative and innovative?
This course does not try teach people how to be creative.  Rather, it teaches us how to stop stopping it.  If we can do that, a person&#39;s natural creativity will easily bloom. 
What are the readings for the course and where are they available?
Freely available readings will be assigned for each course session.  I also recommend that students purchase the book &quot;Creative People Must Be Stopped!&quot; which was written specifically for this course.
What are the course requirements and deliverables?
See next question.
Will I get a certificate for completing the class?
The short answer is yes.  Read on for the long answer:
In recognition that all participants will not have the same goals or time to invest, the course is offered at three levels of engagement.  Each level will receive a different acknowledgement for completing the course.  See the course syllabus for details.  Also see &quot;Course Format&quot; section above for overview.

What is the format of the class?
The class will consist of lecture videos, assigned readings, and exercises.  There will also be individual assignments and team assignments for those taking the advanced levels of the course

How do the teams work (given that this is an online class)?
For those taking the Studio Mastery track, participants will need to work in teams of two-to-five persons to complete the course project assignment.  You are strongly encouraged to recruit other local participants to take the course if only to populate your project team. 

What if I don&#39;t have a team?  How can I find a team to join?
If you cannot find someone to take the course with you, you can post to the class website in order to recruit other team members.  However, you will not be able to start on the assigned group exercises and project deliverables until you have formed and registered your team.

Do I need to watch the lectures live? 
No. You can watch the lectures at your own convenience. 

How much does it cost to take the course? 
The course is free.  When assigned, readings will be available through links on the internet.  See above for information on the recommended (but not required) textbook.

How can I learn more about the course? 
This course is based on the popular Innovation Strategy class at the Owen Graduate School of Management at Vanderbilt University.   To get a sense of how the course works, please check out the VU Course Student Blog, the IdeaScale Site we use for managing ideas and projects, and the recommended textbook that was written for the course.   Finally, this animated video describes the basic intellectual framework of the course.</field>

FAQ
Why history?
This is not history just to memorize dates, places, and people&#39;s names so you can answer questions on an exam. The history of the Internet and the Web is not nearly as simple as it might seem on the surface. There are heroes who saved the day and villains who tried to keep the heroes from saving the day. There were complex engineering issues that needed to be solved in a hurry. By looking at what really happened and hearing directly from those who built it, we also learn about how humans work together to solve large, complex, and undefined problems.

What is the format of the class?
The course is about 60% recorded lectures and 40% video interviews with Internet pioneers. It will be comprised of a series of 10-30 minute segments with some assessment material at the end of each segment. You should expect to spend 2-5 hours per week viewing the material, doing extra readings, participating in discussions with fellow students, and taking the assessments.

Do I need a textbook?
No. The materials are mostly self-contained and extra materials will be available on the Web or available for free from within the course.

Will we need to write programs?
No. No programs. Trust me. No programs.

What about timing? Can I take this self-paced?
Sort of. Within any week of the course, you can look at the material and take assessments whenever you have time available, regardless of your time zone. But we will move the course along and there will be due dates for each assessment to keep us all moving forward together. So you can&#39;t wait until the last week and do all the material in a day or two. We expect that you will be committed and work on the course each week as you would for any other college class.

What is the Twitter hash tag for the course?
The has tag for this course is #IHTS you can see what students are talking about for the class Search IHTS on Twitter.

Can we contact the professor?
The professor will be nearby and monitoring the course. If problems come up, there may be a need for online office hours or even the just-in-time development of extra materials if a lot of students get stuck on a particular topic or idea. The discussion forum is an important part of the class and your fellow students will answer many questions. Teaching staff will monitor and interact in the forums as well. You can follow the instructor on Twitter @drchuck to get a sense of where he is during the course.

Do we need to know HTML?
No. But after you take this course, we hope you get inspired to want to learn HTML.

Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.</field>

Part of the &quot;Fundamentals of Computing&quot; Specialization »
This course is designed to be a fun introduction to the basics of programming in Python. Our main focus will be on building simple interactive games such as Pong, Blackjack and Asteroids.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This course is designed to help students with very little or no computing background learn the basics of building simple interactive applications.  Our language of choice, Python, is an easy-to learn, high-level computer language that is used in many of the computational courses offered on Coursera. To make learning Python easy, we have developed a new browser-based programming environment that makes developing interactive applications in Python simple.  These applications will involve windows whose contents are graphical and respond to buttons, the keyboard and the mouse. 

The primary method for learning the course material will be to work through multiple &quot;mini-projects&quot; in Python.  To make this class enjoyable, these projects will include building fun games such as Pong, Blackjack, and Asteroids.  When you’ve finished our course, we can’t promise that you will be a professional programmer, but we think that you will learn a lot about programming in Python and have fun while you’re doing it.
Course Syllabus
Our course syllabus can be seen at www.codeskulptor.org/coursera/interactivepython.html.
Recommended Background
A knowledge of high school mathematics is required. While the class is designed for students with no prior programming experience, some beginning programmers have viewed the class as being fast-paced. For students interested in some light preparation prior to the start of class, we recommend a self-paced Python learning site such as codecademy.com
Course Format
Our course will last nine weeks.  The lectures from each week will focus on the topics listed in the syllabus while an associated weekly “mini- project” will serve to reinforce these concepts in practice.  Grades for these mini-projects will be determined via peer-assessment.  The class will also include two quizzes each week to provide further feedback.
FAQ
Will I get a certificate after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by Joe, Scott, John, and Stephen.

What resources will I need for this class?
The only requirement for the class is access to a modern web browser. All coding and program development will be done in a web-based programming environment that supports building interactive applications in Python. The programs that you create will be saved, shared and graded via the cloud.

What is the coolest thing I&#39;ll learn if I take this class?
You’ll be able to build your own games in Python.</field>

Learn to better understand and manage cognition, emotion and behavior of people in organizations across different cultural contexts. And reflect on your strengths and development potential as a leader or a leader to be.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
All of us work with other people in organizations. You may be a budding entrepreneur working with a business partner in the proverbial start-up garage, or as chef with kitchen and serving staff in a three star restaurant. You may be part of a globally dispersed team of engineers collaborating virtually on a new aircraft, a member of an online community collectively compiling a web encyclopedia, or a volunteer involved with a network of development aid workers supporting a community hit by humanitarian crisis. The success of any organization we are engaged in – especially when it brings together individuals from across borders and cultures – ultimately depends on how well we understand and are able to manage individual and collective behaviors. 

All of us can contribute to improving the organizations we work in, and social science research can provide us with the tools to do so. Insights from psychologists, neuroscientists, sociologists and anthropologists, from communication scholars and from management scholars allow us to understand what shapes individual and group decision making, what enhances or weakens team performance, and how we can build and use our social networks. In addition, social science research has revealed systematic ways in which our behavior differs across cultural contexts – enabling us to more effectively work across borders.

Learning about organizational behavior provides a great opportunity to develop your leadership skills and to reflect on your own behavioral tendencies. How do you usually make important decisions? What motivates you and how do you try motivating others? How successfully do you leverage and integrate diverse skills and views in a team? Do you prefer professional relationships with a close-knit group of trusted colleagues, or with a far-flung network of acquaintances from all walks of life?

We are looking forward to welcoming you and supporting you on this journey of learning and self-discovery.

An introduction to astronomy through a broad survey of what we know about the universe and how we know it.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
In this class, we will be studying, quite literally, everything in the universe.  We will start with &quot;classical&quot; astronomy, describing the night sky and organizing what we see as was done in ancient times.  We will then embark on a journey, starting here on Earth and progressing outward, to study the Solar system, the Milky Way galaxy, and the wonderful and strange objects we observe in deep space, such as black holes, quasars, and supernovae.  We will end with some discussion of what scientists know today about the universe as a whole.  Along the way we will introduce some of the methods, theoretical and experimental, that have been used to understand all of this, from Newton&#39;s laws, through our understanding of light and matter, to Einstein&#39;s theory of relativity, and from Galileo&#39;s telescope to WMAP.
Course Syllabus
Week 1: Positional Astronomy (naked-eye Astronomy)
We will spend our first week familiarizing ourselves with descriptions of the positions and motions of celestial objects.

Weeks 2-3: Newton’s Universe
Newtonian physics revolutionized the way we understand our Universe.  We will discuss Newton’s laws of mechanics, the conservation laws that follow from them, his theory of gravity and some applications to Astronomy, as well as some properties of radiation.  The last clip will be a quick look at the features of quantum mechanics relevant to our course.  This will be a particularly busy and challenging unit, but hard work here will pay off later.

Week 4: Planets
We will not have time in this course to do justice to the broad and exciting field of planetary science.  We will spend the week on a general review of the properties and structure of our Solar System and our understanding of its origins and history.   We will end with some discussion of the exciting discoveries over the past decade of many hundreds of extrasolar planets.

Week 5: Stars
What we know about stars and a bit about how we found out.    We will begin with a quick review of the best-studied star of all, our Sun.  We will then talk about classifications; H-R diagrams and main sequence stars; distance, mass, and size measurements; binaries; clusters; and stellar evolution through the main sequence

Week 6: Post-Main-Sequence Stars
Final stages of stellar evolution and stellar remnants.   Giants, white dwarfs, novae, variable stars, supernovae, neutron stars and pulsars.

Week 7: Relativity and Black Holes
We will spend most of this week acquiring an understanding of the special theory of relativity.  We will then discuss the general theory in a qualitative way, and discuss its application to black holes, gravitational lensing, and other phenomena of interest.

Week 8: Galaxies
Galactic structure and classification.  Active galactic nuclei, quasars and blazars.  Galactic rotation curves and dark matter.  Galaxy clusters and large-scale structure.

Weeks 9-10: Cosmology
What we can say about the universe as a whole.  Hubble Expansion.  Big bang cosmology. The cosmic microwave background.  Recent determination of cosmological parameters.  Early universe physics.
Recommended Background
An interest in learning something about the universe we live in and a willingness to invest some thought and some work in this.
The ability to calculate with large and small numbers, e.g. to compute the product of  and .
A familiarity with the rudiments of high-school algebra, the ability to solve an equation like  to get    and comfortably use this to obtain numerical values for  in appropriate units given values of , , and , and to draw and use graphs to describe the properties of functions.
A basic background in science at a high school level. What elements, atoms, nuclei, magnetic fields, gravity, etc. are will be assumed familiar.  The details of their physics or its mathematical description will not.
Suggested Readings
There are a lot of important and interesting facts to learn about astronomy, and lectures are a very inefficient way to learn facts.  It would be extremely helpful, but not absolutely necessary, to read any of the many fine textbooks on introductory astronomy that are out there as you take this class and to have it handy as a reference.  One example is &quot;Universe&quot; by Freedman, Geller, and Kaufmann - but there are many other comparable texts and I will not adhere strictly to any of them.  The Wikibook http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/General_Astronomy and Wikipedia entries for topics mentioned in class would be quite sufficient for this purpose, as would the notes by Nick Strobel generously available for free at http://www.astronomynotes.com/. In addition, I recommend (but do not require!) downloading and installing a planetarium application for your computer.  Examples of free downloads sufficient for our purposes include http://www.astrosurf.com/c2a/  (Windows only) or http://www.ap-i.net/skychart/.  The specific software I will use in lecture, http://astronomy.starrynight.com/  will be available to students of the class at a discount price. 
Course Format
There will be video lectures broken up into clips 8-15min. long, about three hours of video per week. There will be quizzes to go with these as well as regular homework assignments designed to help you gain a thorough understanding of the material.
FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this course?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.

Do I need to have had college physics or calculus to take this course?
No. If you have had any of these, you will find them helpful but it is definitely possible to do this class and enjoy it without them. Supplementary notes reviewing the technical aspects of the physical principles we use will be posted to help keep the class as self-contained as possible.

Is this a hard course?
It should be. If done right you will have learned in a few short weeks a lot of truly exciting science, and this will require putting in some time to work on it, and some hard thinking. It should also be a lot of fun.

Do I need a telescope to take this course?
No. I will suggest some observing projects for naked-eye observing and some for telescope observing. If you can find a darkish place to look up at the night sky this will be both rewarding and instructive, and a telescope can amplify both effects if you know how to use it. But not all of us have access to such locations or equipment, and installing one of the planetarium software options allows you to make “observations&quot; on your monitor.

Will this help me improve my skills as an observer?
Not directly. We will not spend much time on details of observational astronomy. We will focus more on the physical nature of astronomical objects. So the class might improve your knowledge of the object you observe, if not your observational technique.</field>

	<field name="course_intro">The Law of the European Union: An Introduction
The EU is the most successful supranational legal order to which 27 Member States have transferred sovereign rights. This course explores the functioning of the unique creature that is the EU, the impact of its laws on states, citizens and companies, and the current challenges it faces.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
In 2012, the EU received the Nobel Peace Prize for its decades-long contribution to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe. War has become virtually unthinkable in the EU. When the first steps towards supranational cooperation - primarily targeted at preventing the rearmament of Germany - were made in the aftermath of World War Two, the Founding Fathers of the European integration construct could never have imagined this outcome in their wildest dreams. Over the years, the supranational cooperation would widen - from the original European Communities consisting of 6 Member States to the current Union of 27 Members – and deepen – from the originally almost purely economically inspired Communities to the current Union with a say in almost all areas of national competence. At the same time, problems with the Euro have plunged the EU in one of the biggest crises since its inception. This challenges lawmakers to tackle difficult questions about the continued existence of the Euro and the future direction of the European integration project.

This course will give the students an insight into the law of the EU, a vast and fascinating area of law which forms an integral part of the legal systems of its 27 Member States. The course is divided into three parts. In the first part, we will pay attention to the creation and the development of the EU, its institutional structure and functioning, and the specific nature and sources of EU law. In the second part, we will examine how EU law impacts on the lives of EU citizens as well as on companies that are established or provide services in the EU. In the final part, we will tackle Europe’s common currency crisis, investigating causes, effects and possible routes out of this existential crisis of the Union.

If you are a student, lawyer, entrepreneur or simply interested in the EU, its development and legal system, this course will provide you with the foundations. The course is of interest to people both inside and outside the European Union: EU citizens may learn how to benefit from the rights contained in EU life; people from other parts of the world may learn from the EU’s specific set-up, its functioning and the legal solutions being applied in the European context.

In-course Textbooks
As a student enrolled in this course, you will have free access to selected chapters and content for the duration of the course. All chapters were selected by the instructor specifically for this course. You will be able to access the Coursera edition of the e-textbook via an e-reader in the class site hosted by Chegg.

Course Syllabus
See the detailed Syllabus. Please note that based on feedback we have received following our first offering of the course, we have decided to extend the duration to fifteen weeks for this, and all subsequent offerings.
Recommended Background
This is a tough issue.  I do not believe in prerequisites, except for a sense of curiosity and an attitude. Having said that, exposure to economics (the mother discipline of finance), accounting (the language of business), and/or algebra and statistics (we all need it) will clearly help.  I will however try and cover everything starting with fundamentals and will highlight when there is a need for you to do some further work in specific subjects.  In fact, I hope the class will motivate you to learn more.  I believe that learning usually happens when you are motivated by a curiosity to understand something.
Suggested Readings
For information on the suggested readings, please see the detailed syllabus.
Course Format
The class will consist of videos, broken up into bite-size pieces with their lengths varying based on the topic. Almost every video segment will have opportunities for you to assess your knowledge. You are strongly encouraged to take every opportunity to work on the problems/examples before you view my analysis. There will also be standalone assignments every week that are not part of videos, and a (not optional) final exam. Doing the assignments is the way you will learn the material.
FAQ
Will I get a certificate after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a certificate signed by the instructor.

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Logic is one of the oldest intellectual disciplines in human history. It dates back to the times of Aristotle; it has been studied through the centuries; and it is still a subject of active investigation today.

This course is a basic introduction to Logic. It shows how to formalize information in form of logical sentences. It shows how to reason systematically with this information to produce all logical conclusions and only logical conclusions. And it examines logic technology and its applications - in mathematics, science, engineering, business, law, and so forth.

The course differs from other introductory courses in Logic in two important ways. First of all, it teaches a novel theory of logic that improves accessibility while preserving rigor. Second, the material is laced with interactive demonstrations and exercises that suggest the many practical applications of the field.

FAQ
Will I get a statement of accomplishment after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a statement of accomplishment signed by the instructor.

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Man has always used external materials to help prevent, cure, or alleviate the symptoms of disease. In fact, Gregory Higby of the American Institute of the History of Pharmacy has written that, “...the very concept of influencing bodily functions via an outside force must be considered one of humanity’s greatest advances.” Since its independent origins in ancient Arabic civilizations, pharmacy has evolved from a craft dedicated to the compounding of drugs to a profession focusing on helping patients get the best outcomes from medication therapies.

So what is pharmacy? How has it changed and where is it headed?

This course will answer these questions and provide a comprehensive introduction to this profession. We will explore the history of pharmacy and its evolving scope of practice; examine educational and career pathways; tackle issues relating to medication safety and adverse drug events; gain insight into the regulatory and ethical considerations in pharmacy practice; and more.

As we explore these topics together, we will hear from practicing pharmacists throughout the course and ultimately gain a better understanding of what they do and how they help us get the best results from our medications. Maybe you will decide that the dynamic profession of pharmacy is a career path that you want to pursue!  Whether student or healthcare consumer, you’re sure to find the material we cover in this course to be invaluable.

Epistemology, where we’ll consider what our knowledge of the world and ourselves consists in, and how we come to have it;
Philosophy of science, where we’ll investigate foundational conceptual issues in scientific research and practice;
Philosophy of Mind, where we’ll ask questions about what it means for something to have a mind, and how minds should be understood and explained;
Moral Philosophy, where we’ll attempt to understand the nature of our moral judgements and reactions – whether they aim at some objective moral truth, or are mere personal or cultural preferences, and;
Metaphysics, where we’ll think through some fundamental conceptual questions about the nature of reality.

This course is all about you ... your mind, your behavior, and what underlies them both. It will be a fast paced tour of the most important experiments in psychology, one that is intended to fascinate, inform, and provoke deep thought. Come learn about yourself with us!</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This course will highlight the most interesting experiments within the field of psychology, discussing the implications of those studies for our understanding of the human mind and human behavior.  We will explore the brain and some of the cognitive abilities it supports like memory, learning, attention, perception and consciousness.  We will examine human development - both in terms of growing up and growing old - and will discuss the manner in which the behavior of others affect our own thoughts and behavior.  Finally we will discuss various forms of mental illness and the treatments that are used to help those who suffer from them.   

The fact of the matter is that humans routinely do amazing things without appreciating how interesting they are.  However, we are also routinely influenced by people and events without always being aware of those influences.  By the end of this course you will have gained a much better understanding and appreciation of who you are and how you work.  And I can guarantee you that you&#39;ll learn things that you&#39;ll be telling your friends and family about, things that will fundamentally change the way you think of yourself and others.  How can you resist that?!
Course Syllabus
The course will be 8 weeks long in total, with topics varying as follows. 

Week 1: A Brief History and Introduction to the Science of Psychology 
Week 2: The Matter of the Mind 
Week 3: Sensation, Perception, Attention and Awareness 
Week 4: Learning 
Week 5: Memory 
Week 6: The Social Mind 
Week 7: Mental Illness
Week 8: Your Requested Extra Lectures!
Recommended Background
No specific background is required.  If you have a hungry mind ... a mind that wants to learn more about itself, then you are most welcome in my course!
Suggested Readings
I do not assume any specific readings.  If you have access to any Introductory Psychology book, you might want to reference it if I discuss something you&#39;d like to learn more about, but you could do that with internet-based research as well.  In addition, we will have a wiki associated with the course, which will allow you guys to expand on the topics I discuss in the course.  That wiki will be made available to all and will allow you to either learn more about certain topics, or share things you learned that are not yet in the wiki.
Course Format
The lectures for each week will contain 8 videos of approximately 10 to 15 minutes each (OK, some might sneak up on 20 mins).  There will be short multiple-choice quizzes at the end of each lecture as well as weekly assignments that will vary from week to week.  These &quot;active learning assignments&quot; will take a number of forms.  Specifically, Digital Labcoat will allow you to play with data in a way that will make the scientific process come to life in a fun and informative way. The mTuner activities consist of specially designed multiple-choice test that allows you to see what you know while simultaneously correcting any misconceptions or misunderstandings you might have, The peerScholar activity will exercise your critical thinking and clear communication skills, and will allow you to learn from and with your fellow students in a collaborative and constructive context.   In addition there will also be short experiments you can participate in to get a better sense of the science of psychology. There will also be a final exam that will give you a clear sense of how much of the course &quot;stuck&quot;. 

All of these activities are designed to be engaging ways of allowing you to use the information your learning.  Using the information is the best way of really making it make sense, and when using it is fun, then deep learning is easy.  That is the goal of this course, to provide you with an active and engaging learning experience that you won&#39;t forget.
FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?

Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.
What resources will I need for this class?

For this course, all you need is an Internet connection, and the time to read, write, discuss, and enjoy some fascinating experiments and ideas.
What is the coolest thing I&#39;ll learn if I take this class?

The coolest?  Where do I begin?  Maybe the coolest thing about all of us is how many things we can do really well, and how we manage to do it.  No machine has yet come even close to being able to do what humans are able to do in the general way we can.  You will also learn about things that influence you without your awareness ... well, until you learn about them that is.  So many cool things! 
What kind of practical knowledge will I gain?  Why is this worth my time?

In addition to gaining a better understanding of yourself you will also gain a better understanding of those around you.  If you interact with other human beings at all (and who doesn&#39;t?) you will be able to do so more effectively.  If you are a manager, a coach, a parent or a friend, this course will help you work with others.</field>

Learn how the discipline of systems engineering can lead to the successful development of complex systems.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Systems engineering is an interdisciplinary approach to design, implementation and evaluation that holds the key to the successful development of complex human-made systems. This course explores a framework encapsulating the entire systems engineering discipline, clearly showing where the multitude of associated activities fits within the overall effort and how the activities relate to one another.  Systems engineering is a very broad discipline, so we also discuss how the concepts and procedures could be applied to individual projects. A new theme will be explored each week using presentations to introduce and synthesise key concepts, examples to simulate authentic contexts, and structured activities to guide your learning. 

The course is relevant to all professions associated with the introduction of complex human-made systems: project managers, engineers, quality assurance representatives, integrated logistic support practitioners, operators, managers, maintainers, and so on, from students to professionals, from novices to experienced practitioners, from technical to non-technical people. 

Course Syllabus
Week One: We begin by addressing the nature of systems and the concept of a system life cycle.

Week Two: We describe the discipline of systems engineering and outline its relevance and benefits.

Week Three: We examine the needs and requirements views developed by business management, business operations, and systems designers.

Week Four: We explore requirements engineering and the processes by which requirements are elicited and defined formally.

Week Five: We examine Conceptual Design, in which we define business needs and requirements as well as stakeholder needs and requirements.

Week Six: We investigate Preliminary Design, in which logical design is translated into physical design and detailed design.

Week Seven: We investigate Construction, Production (in which we complete the design of individual system elements that are then constructed/produced), Utilisation and Disposal of the system.

Week Eight: We discuss the need for control and balance in the management of systems engineering activities, and we identify the relationship between systems engineering and the related disciplines of project management, software engineering, and integrated logistic support.

Week Nine: Course wrap-up.
Recommended Background
No particular background is required. All are welcome.

Suggested Readings
Although the lectures are designed to be self-contained, we recommend (but do not require) that students refer to our textbook—R.I. Faulconbridge and M.J. Ryan, “Systems Engineering Practice”, Argos Press, Canberra, 2014. 

Course Format
The course is divided into eight modules, over nine weeks. Each module typically consists of one or two video lectures, a small number of associated readings, a quiz, and a series of exercises that support the material covered in the week. At the end of the course you will be requested to peer-review selected exercises of a number of other students.



FAQ
Assessment 
The assessment for the course will comprise the weekly quizzes and peer assessment of selected exercises. The principal purpose of the assessment is to provide feedback to you on a weekly basis, but it will also confirm that you have successfully completed the course.

The course does not carry UNSW credit. Students who successfully complete the assessment will receive a certificate of accomplishment.</field>

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
We live in a world where data are increasingly available, in ever larger quantities, and are increasingly expected to form the basis for decisions by governments, businesses, and other organizations, as well as by individuals in their daily lives. To cope effectively, every informed citizen must be statistically literate.  

This course will provide an intuitive introduction to applied statistical reasoning,  introducing fundamental statistical skills and acquainting students with the full process of inquiry and evaluation used in investigations in a wide range of fields.  In particular, the course will cover methods of data collection, constructing effective graphical and numerical displays to understand the data, how to estimate and describe the error in estimates of some important quantities, and the key ideas in how statistical tests can be used to separate significant differences from those that are only a reflection of the natural variability in data.

Course Syllabus
A first look at data 
Weeks 1-2: Summary statistics and graphical displays for a single categorical or quantitative variable and for relationships between two variables.

Collecting data 
Week 2:  Sampling.  Observational studies and experiments.  The effect of confounding and concluding causation.

Probability 
Week 3:  Probability models, the normal distribution, the Law of Large Numbers, the Central Limit Theorem, sampling distributions.

Confidence Intervals 
Week 4: Confidence intervals and sample size estimation for proportions and means.

Tests of significance 
Week 5: Tests of significance, power and sample size estimation for proportions and means

Two samples
Week 6: Tests of significance and confidence intervals for proportions and means in the two sample case.

Simple linear regression 
Week 7: Method of least squares, evaluating model fit, the effects of outliers and influential observations.

The process of statistical inquiry 
Week 8: Capstone case study.

Recommended Background
Students should be comfortable with basic high-school-level mathematics.

Course Format
The course will consist of lecture videos containing integrated quiz questions. There will also be a quiz every week.  At the end of weeks 4 and 8 there will be a short homework assignment.  Optional extra videos are available for students who wish to learn to do their own statistical analyses using the R statistical computing package (http://www.r-project.org/); however, no computing is required to complete the course.

New material will be posted each week, and it is recommended that it be completed during the 7 day period until more material is posted.  While it is recommended that all evaluations be completed in the week they are posted, all evaluations will have a Hard Deadline that is one week later, in order to accommodate variation in students&#39; schedules.

FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?
Yes, students who successfully complete the class, including all videos and quizzes and homework assignments, will receive a Statement of Accomplishment.  To receive credit, all evaluations must be completed before the Hard Deadline.</field>

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This is a course for students who are passionate about classical music and eager to learn more about it, but who have not necessarily had any advanced technical training or taken any college-level music courses. The only prerequisite is a basic knowledge of how to read musical notation. Otherwise, no prior experience is needed; all concepts will be explained in class, and musical terms will be defined as they arise. This course will focus on Western classical music of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, music that exemplifies tonality, the system of major and minor keys, including pieces composed by Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann, Chopin, Wagner, Brahms, Richard Strauss, and others. This course will tell two competing stories about tonal music and try to reconcile them. On one hand, we will explore what all tonal pieces have in common, the shared musical language that makes them intelligible and allows them to communicate; on the other hand, we will try to discover what makes each piece unique, how composers bend the common language to say something new. Although the course will incorporate historical perspectives, it will not be a chronological survey. Instead, it will combine music theory with aesthetics, balancing principles of structural organization with insights into the aesthetic meaning and effects of these principles. By illustrating his lectures with his own performances at the keyboard, Professor Korsyn will bring the music to life.

In this course you will learn the basics of the life-cycle assessment (LCA) method for holistic environmental analysis of products, technologies, and systems. LCA sheds light on the environmental implications of the consumption and behavioral choices we all make on a daily basis.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Paper or plastic? Hybrid or conventional vehicles? Which is better for the environment? To answer these questions, one must take a holistic systems view using a quantitative approach known as life cycle assessment. 

Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a fundamental method for assessing the environmental impacts of products and technologies from a &quot;cradle to grave&quot; systems perspective. It is an essential tool for anyone who performs environmental analyses or uses the results of such analyses for decision making.  

The course will provide an introduction to LCA methods and applications. Students taking this course will emerge with a solid understanding of why an LCA systems perspective is important, basic skills for sound application of the LCA method and proper interpretation of its results, and an appreciation for the strengths and limitations of LCA in practice. The course will cover the four major steps in LCA: (1) goal definition and scope; (2) life-cycle inventory compilation; (3) life-cycle impact assessment; and (4) interpretation and management. The course will include a hands-on modeling project, which the students will perform in parallel to the lectures to reinforce learning objectives and to gain experience in LCA application. 
Course Syllabus
- The basics of energy and mass flows and exchanges with the environment 
- Working with unit processes and unit process inventory data
- Study design: goal definition, system boundaries, and functional units 
- Compiling the data: life-cycle inventory methods (process-based and input-output methods)

This is a six week course providing an overview of Thomas Jefferson&#39;s work and perspectives presented by the University of Virginia in partnership with Thomas Jefferson’s Monticello. Together, UVA and Monticello are recognized internationally as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Born in an age ruled by monarchs, Thomas Jefferson thought that power ought to belong to those who possessed “virtue and talent” rather than to aristocrats who had inherited it. He rejected the power of kings in favor of ordinary people, believing that all men are created equal and possess inherent natural rights. Jefferson became a powerful spokesman for a revolutionary generation of Americans who created a new nation based on these radical ideas. Thomas Jefferson remains today a pivotal figure in American history whose influence continues to be felt nearly two centuries after his death, both in the United States and around the world.  This course will offer an introduction to Jefferson’s thought, focusing on several key ideas and themes that engaged Jefferson throughout his public career and private life.  We will address the three achievements that Jefferson asked to be listed on his tombstone by discussing his roles in writing the Declaration of Independence, in advocating religious freedom, and in advancing the cause of education by founding the University of Virginia.  We will also seek to understand what Jefferson meant when he proclaimed that “the earth belongs to the living.”  And, crucially, we will explore Jefferson’s lifelong relationship with the institution of slavery.

To understand Jefferson’s ideas and why they continue to be relevant today, our approach in each lecture will be to situate Jefferson in the context of his own time and place.  Jefferson lived for many years in different places—Philadelphia, New York, Paris, and Washington D.C., to name but a few—but there is little doubt that he considered his home, Monticello, and the nearby town of Charlottesville, in central Virginia, to be the center of his world.  In this course, produced by the University of Virginia in close partnership with the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, we will explore how Jefferson’s identification with Monticello and the surrounding area influenced him as he formulated ideas that have made a global impact.  After completing the course it should be clear not only why Jefferson&#39;s legacy is essential to understanding American history, but also why UNESCO has designated Jefferson’s Monticello and the University of Virginia as a World Heritage Site.</field>

Course Format

This class consists of the following elements:

Multiple video lectures from your instructor. These will be available starting Monday mornings.
Free downloadable readings. In efforts to make the course more accessible to all, there is no textbook.
Transcripts of the video lectures.
Links and handouts mentioned in video lectures.
One or more announcements from the instructor every week.
Discussion forums. These forums will help you apply the material by interacting with other students in the course.
One weekly quiz for each of modules 1-4 that covers the video lectures. These quizzes are previewed as embedded questions throughout the video lectures.
Study guide to prepare for the cumulative mid-point quiz.
A mid-point quiz consisting of 20 questions. You may take the mid-point quiz twice. The highest score will be counted. The mid-point quiz is cumulative, covering the first 4 weeks of material. It is an open-note and independent activity.
Modules 5, 6, &amp; 7 each require a assignment that will be graded by your peers.
Modules 5, 6, &amp; 7 each require you to complete 3 peer assessments (9).
Optional supplemental social media interaction using #ksuitecmooc
Collaboration

We highly recommend that teacher groups or whole schools take the course together. Meeting once per week in a face-to-face environment to discuss, share resources, and peer critique is advised; however, each person should complete independent assignments…no group projects. Your projects may be closely related, though. For example, in this course you will design a blended or online unit for your class. If a grade level team at the same school decides to divide up the curriculum such that each teacher designs a separate social studies unit for his/her grade level team, then the grade level team’s projects would closely relate while not becoming a single group project. Think professional development jigsaw activity!

Don’t worry if you don’t have a colleague to work with, you can take this class alone. Really you will never be alone! You could harness Google Hangouts or Skype to work with someone you meet in the discussion forums. Don’t be bashful!

Scheduling

To help you plan your time, here is the expected weekly workload:
Week 1: (5 hours) Jan. 6-12
Week 2: (5 hours) Jan 13-19
Week 3: (5 hours) Jan 20-26
Week 4: (5 hours) Jan 27-Feb 2
Week 5: (10 hours) Feb 3-9
Week 6: (10 hours) Feb 10-16
Week 7: (10 hours) Feb 17-23
Week 8: (&lt;2 hours) Feb 24-Mar 3

If you are taking this course with your professional learning network or grade-level team, we recommend setting aside 1-2 hours each week to meet face-to-face or synchronously to discuss key points, individual progress, resources, and to give peer feedback.

Recommended Background
While the course is designed with in-service K12 teachers in mind, this course is taught for anyone interested in K12 education such as preservice teachers, homeschool teachers, and other community members. Consider reviewing educational terminology before beginning the course by reading all the suggested readings before the first day of class. 

Suggested Readings
All readings will be provided for download in the course at no cost to the student. 
If you want to save time and get a head start, begin by these key course readings:

Course Format
The course will be delivered in seven modules. The first six modules will last one week. Module seven is a two-week unit. 

Each of the first four modules contain lecture videos, a module quiz, discussions, and opportunities for peer to peer interaction. A cumulative midpoint quiz covers the first four modules. The latter three modules also contain lecture videos, discussions, and opportunities for peer to peer interaction. In these modules, participants are also required to create 3 peer-assessed learning objects (that can be used in the participant&#39;s own k-12 classroom). 

FAQ
Statements of Accomplishment

To receive a Statement of Accomplishment, you must earn at least 80% of course points.

Teacher Professional Learning Credits, Certificates, and University Course Credit

Teachers Outside Georgia, USA: When you complete the entire 8 week course, your Coursera Statement of Accomplishment will indicate 50 hours of professional learning. For K12 teachers, it is up to individual state licensing agencies as to whether they will accept the certificate as evidence of acceptable teacher training.

Teachers in Georgia, USA ONLY: Teachers in the state of Georgia can receive 5 Professional Learning Units (PLUs) using the free Coursera Statement of Accomplishment for the entire 8 week course. Steps to obtaining the PLU credit from the Georgia PSC will be linked at the end of the course. If Georgia teachers choose to only complete the first 4 weeks, they can still receive 2 PLUs indicating 20 hours of professional learning; however, that certificate must be requested from KSU using the form linked at the end of module 4 for Georgia teachers. No other partial credit options will be granted.

Teachers in Texas, USA ONLY: This course is pending Continuing Professional Education (CPE) activities approval by the Texas Education Agency. The application was submitted and received on November 4, 2013. If approval is granted, rules and processes will resemble those for Georgia teachers with links specific to Texas provided at the end of week 4 and week 8.

University Course Credit: For graduate course credit, there will be a modest fee assessed by Kennesaw State University for academic evaluation of your 3 completed course assignments and Statement of Accomplishment. For more information about seeking KSU graduate credit visit: http://mooc.kennesaw.edu/.  Additional information will be linked at the end of week 8.

Other state licensing agencies that would like to offer professional learning credit for this free course should make initial contact with KSU using the contact information found at https://education.kennesaw.edu/instructionaltechnology/.

When John F. Kennedy entered the presidential limousine at Love Field in Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963, he began his ride into history. That journey continues even today and we call it the Kennedy legacy. 

In the weeks leading up to the 50th anniversary of the assassination, this course will explore the Presidency, assassination, and lasting legacy of President John F. Kennedy. Students will learn how JFK’s life, administration, and tragic death have influenced the general public, the media, and each of the nine U.S. presidents who followed.

Understanding the Kennedy legacy and being able to identify elements of his legacy within the context of modern politics helps understand many of the vexing problems that developed over the last half century as well as many of the challenges that confront us today.    
    
November 22, 1963 was so powerful a moment that in the fifty years since the assassination, every U.S. President that followed JFK has used Kennedy’s words and actions in an effort to craft their own political image. Why does Kennedy’s influence persist, and will it continue? What are the effects? 

We’ll address these questions and more as we explore The Kennedy Half Century.

	<field name="course_intro">Søren Kierkegaard - Subjectivity, Irony and the Crisis of Modernity
In this course we will explore how Kierkegaard deals with the problems associated with relativism, the lack of meaning and the undermining of religious faith that are typical of modern life. His penetrating analyses are still highly relevant today and have been seen as insightful for the leading figures of Existentialism, Post-Structuralism and Post-Modernism.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
It is often claimed that relativism, subjectivism and nihilism are typically modern philosophical problems that emerge with the breakdown of traditional values, customs and ways of life. The result is the absence of meaning, the lapse of religious faith, and feeling of alienation that is so widespread in modernity. 
The Danish thinker Søren Kierkegaard (1813-55) gave one of the most penetrating analyses of this complex phenomenon of modernity. But somewhat surprisingly he seeks insight into it not in any modern thinker but rather in an ancient one, the Greek philosopher Socrates.

This course will highlight the critical legal and business issues entrepreneurs face as they build and launch a new venture. We will explore real world scenarios, and address the legal and business issues that entrepreneurs face, from the moment they conceive of the &quot;million dollar idea&quot; to all of the important junctures along the path to success.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Are you a passionate entrepreneur with a new business idea, but feeling intimidated by the law?  Or perhaps you are a lawyer or aspiring lawyer looking to break into the exciting world of start-ups?  This course addresses the legal aspects of entrepreneurship, and is appropriate both for entrepreneurs and lawyers who hope to represent entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs face many challenges as they pursue a new business idea.  With the right legal tools, they can take steps that provide significant legal protections and avoid future liability.  Among other subjects, the course will cover American law on choice of entity (corporation, limited liability company, partnership, sole proprietorship), selection of a company name and trademark, protecting intellectual property of the business with patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright law, structuring agreements among owners, venture capital and other equity and debt financing arrangements, and the relationship between attorneys and entrepreneurs. In addition to discussing applicable legal rules, the course will focus on practical steps entrepreneurs and their lawyers can take to build and protect a new venture.  The goal of the course will be for students to have a better understanding of practical ways they can protect a new venture and spot potential issues from a business-legal perspective.

Think about the oldest and most familiar principles of American law, property and proportional liability, in a new and surprising way, and learn to apply economic reasoning to an especially important and interesting aspect of life.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
One of the most interesting and important developments in social science since 1970 has been the &quot;discovery&quot; of a consistent economic logic underlying the great common law subjects of property, contract, tort and crime, the thousand-year-old bedrock of the English and American legal systems. Property and contract provide the institutional scaffolding that makes free exchange in markets possible, while the liability systems of tort and crime appear to mimic market exchange in areas of human activity where free exchange itself, for well-defined reasons, is not possible. This course seeks to expose this underlying economic logic through the close investigation of a series of paradigmatic problems and examples in light of some simple but very powerful economic ideas. The course assumes no prior background in economics or law, and begins with an introduction to the basic concepts of property, exchange, efficiency and externality. On this foundation, specific topics in the law, including property, tort and crime, eminent domain, intellectual property and criminal procedure, are considered. Each group of lectures will elaborate on a different concrete problem or example to suggest the range of legal issues and questions to which economic reasoning can be productively applied. The ideas and modes of analysis developed in the course are not difficult or mysterious, but the questions of interpretation and policy that they raise about a subject that affects everyone are challenging and provocative.

Recommended Background
No background is required; all are welcome!
Suggested Readings
The lectures are designed to stand alone, and there are no required readings, though I will recommend some short, internet-accessible readings at various points in the course for students who are interested in pursuing some of the issues raised in the lectures more deeply. In addition, several judicial opinions are discussed throughout the course, and each of these is accompanied by a full citation in the lecture itself. It&#39;s easy to find these cases on many sites on the internet, and interested students are encouraged to find and read them for themselves.
Course Format
This course consists of 39 lectures, each between 15 and 30 minutes in length. The syllabus is divided into six parts, with five to eight lectures in each part, and we&#39;ll cover one part during each week of the course. Every lecture includes several easy, ungraded questions to see whether you&#39;ve understood what you&#39;ve just heard, and if you find yourself unable to answer one of these correctly, you can simply listen to that segment of the lecture again to find the answer, or skip the question and continue the lecture. Along with each of the six parts of the syllabus comes a set of questions and simple problems separate from the lectures to help you think about the lecture material a little more deeply. These six exercises are called &quot;quizzes.&quot; To earn the Statement of Accomplishment, you must complete all six of the quizzes and keep working on them until you reach a score of 75% correct on each quiz.  
FAQ
* Will I get a statement of accomplishment after completing this class?
Yes. Students who complete all six quizzes with a grade of 75% or higher by March 31, 2014 will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor that confirms that they have successfully completed the course. Because the course is meant to be as accessible and enjoyable for as many people as possible, it is not intended to be competitive. Students may submit each quiz as many times as needed to achieve a grade of 75% or higher, and grades of Distinction will not be given. 

* What resources will I need for this class?
Nothing but an internet connection, an open mind, and a willingness to think about things in new ways.</field>

	<field name="course_intro">Inspiring Leadership through Emotional Intelligence
Emotional intelligence, hope, mindfulness, and compassion help a person reverse the damage of chronic stress and build great leadership relationships. The Positive and Negative Emotional Attractors inspire sustained, desired change and learning at many levels.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Great leaders move us through our emotions. They establish a deep emotional connection with others called resonance. Their own levels of emotional intelligence allow them to create and nurture these resonant relationships. They use their EI as a path to resonant leadership through mindfulness, hope, compassion, and playfulness. Unfortunately, most people in leadership and helping positions (i.e., doctors, teachers, coaches, etc.) lose their effectiveness over time because of the cumulative damage from chronic stress. But humans can renew themselves, neurologically, hormonally, and emotionally.

Based on decades of research into emotional intelligence competencies and longitudinal studies of their development, the course will examine resonance and developing &quot;resonant leadership&quot; capability, emotional intelligence, and the experiences of mindfulness, hope, and compassion. Using the latest in neuroscience, behavioral, organizational and psychological research, participants will understand the theory, research, and experience of the Positive Emotional Attractor that is an essential beginning to sustained, desired change for individuals, teams, organizations and communities. 

The course will consist of nine classes, with three or so modules per class, to be taken over 8 weeks. Each module will consist of a video, assigned and recommended readings, reflective exercises, writing in your Personal Journal, and on-line, asynchronous discussions. Each class will have personal learning assignments to use and tests of comprehension.

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Linear Programming (LP) is arguably one of the most important optimization problems in applied mathematics and engineering. The Simplex algorithm to solve linear programs is widely regarded as one among the &quot;top ten&quot; algorithms of the 20th century. Linear Programs arise in almost all fields of engineering including operations research, statistics, machine learning, control system design, scheduling, formal verification and computer vision. It forms the basis for numerous approaches to solving hard combinatorial optimization problems through randomization and approximation.



The primary goals of this course will be to:

1. Understand the basic theory behind LP, algorithms to solve LPs, and the basics of (mixed) integer programs.

2. Understand important and emerging applications of LP to economic problems (optimal resource allocation, scheduling problems), machine learning (SVM), control design (finite horizon optimal control, dynamic programming), and formal verification (ranking functions, symbolic execution, SMT solvers).

At the end of the course, the successful student will be able to cast various problems that may arise in her research as optimization problems, understand the cases where the optimization problem will be linear, choose appropriate solution methods and interpret results appropriately. This is generally considered a useful ability in many research areas.

Suggested Readings
No textbook is required. But, if the student has access to one it can help a lot.

Optional Textbook #1: Linear Programming by Vasek Chvatal, W.H. Freeman published, 1983. This book still remains a very clear and concise presentation. 

Alternate Textbook: Linear Programming by Robert J. Vanderbei (available online through Springer-Link).

Other texts: We may borrow material that is covered in some of the texts below. As you go down this list, the texts become less relevant for this class but remain very important for the broader field of optimization that we seek to introduce through this class.

Combinatorial optimization: Algorithms &amp; Complexity, by Christos Papadimitrou and Ken Steglitz.
Linear Programming series of two books by G.B. Danzig and M.K. Thapa.
Schrijver&#39;s book on the Theory of Integer Linear Programming and Integer, Integer and Combinatoral Optimization book by Wolsey and Nemhauser are also good references. 
Convex Optimization by Boyd and Vandenbreghe is a good reference for the more general area of convex optimization.
Numerical Optimization by Nocedal and Wright is a great reference for solving non-linear optimization problems. 
Course Format
Each class will consist of many short lecture videos between 10-15 minutes in length inter mingled with assessments. There are optional programming exercises that will involve building LP and ILP solvers.

The course will be structured with two interactive tracks: algorithms/theory for linear optimization problems and applications. The applications will include ideas on modeling real-life optimization problems as linear programs and the appropriate use of concepts like duality in finding and interpreting solutions.
FAQ
Will I get a statement of accomplishment after completing this class?
Yes, students who complete the assignments and score a minimum percentage in the quizzes will be given a statement of accomplishment.

What textbooks will I need for this class?
No textbook is officially required. However, there are numerous great textbooks on this topic. We are hoping you will be able to find one. You can always cross check whether your textbook has adequate coverage for the topics to be taught in this class. 

We recommend a classic textbook by Chvatal titled &quot;Linear Programming&quot;. A more recent text by Vanderbei (see http://www.princeton.edu/~rvdb/LPbook/) is also an excellent textbook. It may be available as a download from Springer or some of you whose organization subscribes to Springer Online.  

Can I get course credits for this class?
Unfortunately, not at this time. University of Colorado, Boulder may be considering ways of recognizing Coursera classes, but there is no consensus at this point in time.

However, Prof. Sankaranarayanan is teaching an on-campus class (CSCI 5654, fall 2013) at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and it will be available simultaneously on-line for credit through CAETE (see http://cuengineeringonline.colorado.edu/ ). You can enroll for our class CSCI 5654 through CAETE from anywhere in the world. This version will run through fall 2013 and have weekly assignments/exams. 

How theoretical does this class get: are we going to do rigorous mathematical proofs? How much programming do you expect to do? 
These questions are a little harder to answer: Sriram Sankaranarayanan&#39;s background is in theoretical computer science, while Shalom is a mechanical engineer. We would like to present the theory that underlies linear programming: it is very rich and elegant. Furthermore, if you would like to go beyond using LP solvers as a black box, we highly recommend that you understand the theory and algorithms behind these solvers. But the course will de-emphasize doing rigorous proofs, and emphasize gaining an understanding that enables the student to carry out these proofs when necessary. 

Programming skills tend to vary. We expect students to be able to program some of the algorithms we teach them. But it is very hard to grade programs, and provide meaningful feedback on them. Therefore, the programming of the algorithms will be an optional component to this course. We ourselves will post programs and data files. We will hope that these are of some use to students wishing to write their own code. We will have discussions that will facilitate this aspect of the class.

Some assignments may require the student to setup and solve LPs using a computer. We hope that will not present a problem. We will support open source software such as GNUs GLPK that will be easy to install and easy to work with. However, students with access to Matlab or who wish to solve LPs through APIs in languages like python, C/C++, Java, Scala or OCaml will receive our support, to the best of our abilities.</field>

	<field name="course_intro">Live!: A History of Art for Artists, Animators and Gamers
Explore art history from the artist&#39;s perspective. Learn how contemporary artists, animators and gamers work from the art of the past as part of their creative process, while building your own skills in visual analysis and creative and critical thinking.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This course approaches the questions of “art” and “history” from the perspective of contemporary makers of art (sculpture, painting, photography, performance, installation and more), animators (whether character/story-based or experimental) and gamers, asking how artists actively make a history for their own practices by thinking about the creative process as a “conversation” with a wide range of art from the past.  Why are ground-breaking artists so often historically-minded (and yet tend to break all the rules of conventional history-telling)?  How do animators themselves “write” the largely unwritten history of their art through quotation, transposition and mash-ups?  Why should contemporary gamers look at classical painting anyway?

This course will combine short video lectures/interviews and interactive quizzes with independent, peer-reviewed sketchbook and field work (suggested visits to local museums, film viewings, etc.).  It is intended to give the student a background in a wide range of visual practices and a greater familiarity with techniques of historical analysis.  It will help to build skills in visual analysis, and will also provide insight into the creative culture of CalArts, where a certain portion of these art histories have been made in the first place.

Recommended Background
Some college-level experience in the arts and humanities will be helpful.  And the more the student is willing to complement classwork with independent looking and thinking about art, animation and video games (as well as comic books and graphic novels, film, etc.), the more they will get out of the class.  Remember:  Art is an ongoing process and art practice can&#39;t end in the classroom, wherever that classroom might be.
Course Format
This class will consist of video lectures (about 10 minutes in length) combined with video interviews with guest artists and virtual &quot;field trips&quot; to artist studios and workplaces, museums and galleries.  Lectures will focus on key topics, including &quot;story,&quot; &quot;character,&quot; &quot;language,&quot; &quot;time,&quot; &quot;dimensionality,&quot; &quot;novelty,&quot; etc., exposing students to a wide range of art from around the world.  Students will be required to keep a sketchbook, complete &quot;looking, thinking and making&quot; assignments for peer assessment.  A final exam will test comprehension of key concepts.
FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?

Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.

What resources will I need for this class? 
You will need an internet connection, a 9x12 sketchbook and materials of your choice (pencil, pens, photos and other collage materials), a camera or other digital image recorder, and time enough to look, read and think. Each student will be encouraged to make use of local resources, including museums, galleries and libraries.  Selected readings will be available for free. An optional reading list will suggest books for purchase. 
Why should I take this class? 
Visual media is all around us--it&#39;s as much our &quot;real world&quot; as is our physical surroundings.  As an artist, you need to understand how looking at and responding to art is a critical part of the creative process. As a member of the media sphere, it&#39;s important to be a critical viewer. Otherwise, you&#39;re just being &quot;sold.&quot;

What can I do to prepare for this class? 
Be curious and interested in the world around you. Go to as many film screenings, art exhibitions and events as you can. Keep a sketchbook, if you don&#39;t already. Read. Make work. And if you&#39;d like, join our Facebook page, where you can find more resources, make connections, and get a preview of what&#39;s in store as we prepare to launch the class in February 2014.</field>

This is an introduction to formal logic and how it is applied in computer science, electronic engineering, linguistics and philosophy. You will learn propositional logic—its language, interpretations and proofs, and apply it to solve problems in a wide range of disciplines.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Information is everywhere: in our words and our world, our thoughts and our theories, our devices and our databases. Logic is the study of that information: the features it has, how it’s represented, and how we can manipulate it. Learning logic helps you formulate and answer many different questions about information:

Does this hypothesis clash with the evidence we have or is it consistent with the evidence?
Is this argument watertight, or do we need to add more to make the conclusion to really follow from the premises?
Do these two sentences say the same things in different ways, or do they say something subtly different?
Does this information follow from what’s in this database, and what procedure could we use to get the answer quickly?
Is there a more cost-effective design for this digital circuit? And how can we specify what the circuit is meant to do so we could check that this design does what we want?
These are questions about Logic. When you learn logic you&#39;ll learn to recognise patterns of information and the way it can be represented. These skills are used whether we&#39;re dealing with theories, databases, digital circuits, meaning in language, or mathematical reasoning, and they will be used in the future in ways we haven&#39;t yet imagined. Learning logic is a central part of learning to think well, and this course will help you learn logic and how you can apply it.

If you take this subject, you will learn how to use the core tools in logic: the idea of a formal language, which gives us a way to talk about logical structure; and we&#39;ll introduce and explain the central logical concepts such as consistency and validity; models; and proofs. But you won’t only learn concepts and tools. We will also explore how these techniques connect with issues in linguistics, computer science, electronic engineering, and philosophy.
Course Syllabus
Week 1. The Syntax of Propositional Logic; Truth Tables; Classifying Propositions

Week 2. Relationships between Propositions; Tree Proofs; Soundness and Completeness

Weeks 3–5. Applications to different reasoning domains (take at least two):
Electronic Engineering — simplifying digital circuits
Philosophy — vagueness and borderline cases
Computer Science — databases, resolution and propositional Prolog
Linguistics — meaning: implication vs implicature
Recommended Background
This subject presumes no specialist background knowledge. You just need to be able to read and write, and be prepared to think, work and learn new skills—in particular, a willingness to work with symbolic representation and reasoning.
Suggested Readings
The course is self contained, with all required resources available online.

The textbook Logic (Greg Restall, Routledge 2000; especially chapters 1 to 5) covers most but not all of the material in this course. If you like following along with a book, this one will suit the course, but it is complementary and not necessary. We will provide you with a comprehensive set of written course notes, as well as the lecture videos and other freely available teaching resources.
Course Format
The class will consist of lecture videos, which are between 5 and 15 minutes in length. They will contain integrated quiz questions to give you immediate feedback. There will be practice problems available for your to sharpen your skills, and grading problems to form a part of your final grade. In weeks 3-5 there are four topics, from which each student is expected to choose at least two. These will be assessed by a combination of quizzes and short assignments. There is a final exam to wrap everything up.
FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructors.

What resources will I need for this class?
For this course, all you need is an Internet connection, and the time to watch the lectures, read the notes, practice your skills, think, and discuss the material online with other people participating in the class.

What if I love this subject and I want to learn more logic?
Immediately after Logic 1, we’re be teaching Logic: Language and Information 2, and introduction to first order predicate logic and its connections to computer science, electronic engineering, linguistics, mathematics and philosophy.</field>

Based upon the successful educational resources of the same name, the Learning to Teach Online (LTTO) MOOC is designed to help existing educators establish or improve their own online or blended teaching practices. The target audience is primarily teachers in higher education, K-12, community college, and vocational or private education.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Are you an educator? Have you ever wanted to understand more about how to design your course to make better use of educational technology – whether fully online or in blended contexts? Would you like to learn from those who have extensive practical experience with online technologies? This course is designed to help you develop a working understanding of successful online teaching strategies that you can apply in your own practice.

Integrating online technologies into your teaching can be a challenging prospect, and it can be difficult to know how to approach it effectively for the benefit of both students and yourself. No one knows your own content and teaching strengths better than you, and the “one size fits all” formula doesn’t always suit everyone. No matter what type of technology you are interested in exploring or your level of experience, this course will help you draw on your teaching strengths and find the approach that is right for you, your students and your educational context. To allow both for breadth in personalization and depth in key areas that interest you, this course will guide you through your journey of understanding how online technologies can enhance your course design. 

Course Syllabus
Week 1: What is online teaching and why is it important? Overview of online ethnographies and technologies and their place in contemporary education.

Week 2: Technology: Learning management system or the open web? An examination of the pros and cons of the use of social media vs contained systems in educational contexts, and an examination of relevant activities.

Week 3: Planning online learning: Understand how to define your learning outcomes, develop appropriate online activities and assessment strategies, and to choose the right technology to use. These themes are continually revisited throughout the remainder of the course.

Week 4: Online learning activities: Types of online activities and teaching scenarios. Overview and exemplification of a range of fully online, blended and mobile learning scenarios, interaction and applications, and online resources and activities. Issues concerning accessibility and inclusivity also explored.

Week 5: Assessment strategies. Aligning assessment with learning outcomes and designing assessments for learning. Considerations of using technology to enhance assessments – benefits to the instructor and the students. Design and purpose of standards-based assessment and rubrics. Issues concerning assessment feedback and practical affordances provided by technologies are explored.

Week 6: Integration of online resources into your teaching. What role can online resources play in effectively supporting student learning? Understand how to find and use a range of Open Educational Resources (OER) in your class, and explore options for creating and your own online resources. Issues of Creative Commons and Copyright in online education are also discussed.

Week 7: Engaging and motivating students, managing your time online as an instructor. Best practices discussed and identified for building an online community of learners. 

Week 8: Evaluating your Course Design. What are some evaluation methods for determining whether your course design change has been effective? Suggestions for ways of gaining feedback from students to inform your continued teaching practice and pedagogical decisions. How can learning analytics from the use of online technologies help you identify that your course design is helping meet your intended aims and outcomes?

Recommended Background
There is no requirement for participants to possess prior knowledge or experience of online teaching practices or related technologies. This course is relevant for those:
New to online or blended teaching or those wishing to improve their current practice
Interested in educational technology and/or online instruction
Involved in higher education, K-12, community college, vocational or corporate training
Who wish to continue their professional development and increase their relevance and value to the contemporary workplace
Who are learning and teaching professionals (education developers, instructional designers, etc) 
Suggested Readings
Readings and videos will be supplied as part of the weekly course material.

Course Format
This MOOC is designed to provide a flexible, reflective and personal learning experience - enabling you to tailor your learning based upon your own goals, requirements and level of commitment. Each week there will be a set of video case studies exploring a range of key concepts related to course design and teaching with online technologies. You will also engage in discussions with your peers, and participate in formative activities that will help you develop your understanding of the concepts discussed. 

You can choose to study a standard or distinction stream in this course. If you engage in the standard stream, you can expect to build an understanding of contemporary issues surrounding the use of technology in teaching and course design. If you wish to study the distinction stream, you will be expected to undertake a series of assessment tasks that give you the opportunity to progressively apply what you learn to the development of your own online activity or course design. No matter which stream you choose to participate in, you can engage with as much content as you like and access a range of additional resources, assessments, and scholarly readings to have a deeper learning experience.

FAQ
What will I learn in this class?

You will learn strategies and best practices to help you plan, develop and teach using online technologies. You will also learn how best to engage and enthuse students within online learning environments and activities, and how to manage your own time when teaching online. The course focuses on developing your understanding of effective, sustainable and transferable online pedagogies, rather than giving instruction about how to use specific technologies. By understanding how different types of technology relate to various types of learning activities, your online teaching practice can be adapted to whatever different technologies that you may choose to learn.

What is the coolest thing about this class?

The content is comprised of the shared knowledge and wisdom of real educators and students who are engaged in online learning in a wide variety of forms. Not only are the benefits of online teaching discussed, but the pitfalls and frustrations as well, offering genuine practical advice to help prevent you making the same mistakes in your own online teaching.</field>

M2O2C2 provides a first taste of multivariable differential calculus. By introducing the machinery of linear algebra, this course provides helpful tools for understanding the derivative of a function of many variables.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
M2O2C2 is an invitation to think carefully about how one thing changing affects something else. What is the &quot;derivative&quot; of a function of many variables? How can a curved object be approximated by a flat plane? What does the chain rule look like when many things are affecting many other things? How do we find an input which maximizes a function of many variables?

This is a first course in multivariable differential calculus, but along the way, we will also introduce a ton of linear algebra. The result is a course targeted at a student who has seen a bit of calculus and who is willing to learn about linear transformations and vectors; such a student will have the best possible vantage point from which to explore derivatives of functions of many variables.
Course Syllabus
This course is a first taste of multivariable calculus, but viewed through the lens of linear algebra. Introducing matrices (and linear transformations!) permits us to share a more coherent story about multivariable differential calculus.

Week 1: Multiple variables
Week 2: Limits and derivatives
Week 3: The chain rule
Week 4: Second derivative
Week 5: Optimization
Week 6: Higher derivatives
Recommended Background
Previous exposure to calculus is expected; limits and derivatives will appear in this course. That said, if you are feeling rusty or uncertain, I&#39;d encourage you to enroll to take a look. You might remember more than you think!
Suggested Readings
There are great open source calculus texts available, for example,  
http://www.whitman.edu/mathematics/multivariable/ 

We will be providing other free resources to help you succeed in the course.
Course Format
This course is structured around online activities in which we cooperatively develop the main ideas. Short lecture videos summarize the concepts and quizzes will let you practice your skills. The final exam is your opportunity to demonstrate all that you have learned.
FAQ
Will I get a statement of accomplishment after completing the course?

Yes.  All students who earn 70% of the possible points will earn a certificate signed by the instructors; students who earn 90% of the possible points will earn a certificate with distinction signed by the instructors.

What resources will I need to succeed in this course?

Mathematics is a human activity which is as much about understanding as it is about computation: to participate in this conceptual quest, pen and paper is highly recommended.

Do I have to program in Python?

Not at all.  We will provide some optional programming activities as an experiment. If you like them, let us know.  And if you don&#39;t like them, let us know.

What is the coolest thing I&#39;ll learn if I take this course?

The true nature of the derivative.  This course involves a ton of linear algebra, so we&#39;ll develop a rather fancy perspective on the derivative; an upshot of this perspective is that the &quot;chain rule&quot; is just the composition of linear maps, which can be computed by multiplying matrices.  And if this all sounds confusing, don&#39;t worry! Our goal in teaching this course is to tell this story.</field>

All of us are affected by macroeconomic forces – they shape the very world we live in. And governments all around the world try to shape those forces in ways that (hopefully) improve the lives of their constituents. In this subject, we will examine the major theories used by macro economists to analyse national economies and the international economy.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
In this course, we will examine the main bodies of economic theory that have been used to guide economists’ and policy makers’ understanding of the macroeconomy. Macroeconomics is a word derived from the Greek prefix “makros”, meaning large. It is the study of economic aggregates, of national and international economies and of the economic management role played by governments and international organisations.

The founder of modern macroeconomics, the British economist John Maynard Keynes, famously wrote “The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and when they are wrong are more powerful than is commonly understood. Indeed, the world is ruled by little else. Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually slaves of some defunct economist.” This will be the key theme we explore in the course, the influence of theory and the way that policy responses to events like recession, unemployment, inflation and the Global Financial Crisis, reflect that theory.

We will cover important macroeconomic concepts such as the national accounts, unemployment and inflation, explain how the ideas associated with John Maynard Keynes laid the foundation for governments’ active management of the macroeconomy in the post war era, and examine the intellectual basis for the monetary and fiscal policy responses to the Global Financial Crisis.  Economists’ approaches to the analysis of long run economic growth will also be considered. The approach will be critical. There are few areas of human endeavour that attract so much debate and disagreement as the management of a modern industrial economy. We will not shy away from those debates. But what we will do is emphasise the systematic theorising that underlies the way macroeconomists and policy makers approach their task. The aim is to enable those who take the course to become informed analysts of the macroeconomy and of current (and past) macroeconomic policy debates.

Learn about traditional and mobile malware, the security threats they represent, state-of-the-art analysis and detection techniques, and the underground ecosystem that drives such a profitable but illegal business.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Cybercrime has become both more widespread and harder to battle. Researchers and anecdotal experience show that the cybercrime scene is becoming increasingly organized and consolidated, with strong links also to traditional criminal networks. Modern attacks are indeed stealthy and often profit oriented. 

Malicious software (malware) is the traditional way in which cybercriminals infect user and enterprise hosts to gain access to their private, financial, and intellectual property data. Once stolen, such information can enable more sophisticated attacks, generate illegal revenue, and allow for cyber-espionage. 

By mixing a practical, hands-on approach with the theory and techniques behind the scene, the course discusses the current academic and underground research in the field, trying to answer the foremost question about malware and underground economy, namely, &quot;Should we care?&quot;.

 Students will learn how traditional and mobile malware work, how they are analyzed and detected, peering through the underground ecosystem that drives this profitable but illegal business. Understanding how malware operates is of paramount importance to form knowledgeable experts, teachers, researchers, and practitioners able to fight back. Besides, it allows us to gather intimate knowledge of the systems and the threats, which is a necessary step to successfully devise novel, effective, and practical mitigation techniques.
Recommended Background
Operating Systems, Computer Architecture, Computer Security Class (optional)
Course Format
The course materials will incorporate video/audio learning content with formative assessments and the addition of hands-on challenges to be completed by the students as self-assessed study.
FAQ
How does this differ from a Computer Security class?
 “Computer Security” is more focused on teaching students how to design and build secure systems and write secure code. To this end, traditional software vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques are presented, leading eventually to a discussion of malware. Conversely, while such a class will likely touch on some software vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques too for completeness (as those are often the prelude to a malware infection nowadays), the overall goal here is at focusing on the analysis and detection of (traditional and mobile) malicious software, peering also through the underground ecosystem linked to it. The two classes are definitely complementary.

If I have not programmed before, can I still take the course?
Probably not.

The past decade has seen an explosion of new mechanisms for understanding and using location information in widely-accessible technologies. This Geospatial Revolution has resulted in the development of consumer GPS tools, interactive web maps, and location-aware mobile devices. These radical advances are making it possible for people from all walks of life to use, collect, and understand spatial information like never before.
 
This course brings together core concepts in cartography, geographic information systems, and spatial thinking with real-world examples to provide the fundamentals necessary to engage with Geography beyond the surface-level. We will explore what makes spatial information special, how spatial data is created, how spatial analysis is conducted, and how to design maps so that they’re effective at telling the stories we wish to share. To gain experience using this knowledge, we will work with the latest mapping and analysis software to explore geographic problems. 
Course Syllabus
Detailed Course Outline.

Week One: The Geospatial Revolution; highlighting the massive changes in geospatial and mapping technology in recent years and their impact on people from all walks of life.
 
Week Two: Spatial is special; an exploration of spatial thinking and geographic thought to provide the context necessary to understand the underpinnings of the Geospatial Revolution.
 
Week Three: Spatial data; how spatial data is created, what makes it different from other types of information, and how it is managed using new technologies.
 
Week Four: Spatial analysis; basic techniques for solving geographic problems that take spatial relationships into account.
 
Week Five: Cartographic design; fundamentals necessary to design great maps to tell compelling stories about geographic patterns.

PART OF THE WHARTON FOUNDATION SERIES 

This course is part of the Wharton foundation series in the MOOC format. It is taught by three of Wharton&#39;s top faculty in the marketing department, which is consistently ranked as the #1 marketing department in the world. This course features on-location videos and debates between the three professors.

The three core topics focus on customer loyalty. The first is about branding: given a very disparate world in which new startups are emerging constantly, brand equity is one of the key elements of keeping customers so that they have a trusted source for their needs. The second topic is customer centricity, which is taught in a global context where students learn how to gather needs and focus on the customer via discussion forums and empirical examples which are advanced by the mix of cultures in the course. Finally, the course explores practical, go-to-market strategies to help students understand the drivers that influence customers and see how these are implemented prior to making an investment.

This course explores markets with frictions. The goal is to sharpen our economic reasoning, add a few twists that you are unlikely to have seen in other courses, and apply the methods to interesting phenomena. This should improve the way you think analytically about the economy, and help address interesting issues that come up in the real world.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
The classical economic theory of markets cannot account for some important issues, such as the coexistence of unemployment and vacancies; credit market rationing; or bubbles in asset prices. This course will explore markets with frictions, shedding light on these issues and other fundamental questions such as: What is a bank, and why do we use money?

Recommended Background
Students should at some point have taken intermediate to advanced undergraduate courses in economics (intermediate microeconomics) and have minimal proficiency in algebra and calculus.

FAQ
What is a Friction? 
A “Friction” is a restriction imposed by nature that may make it difficult to achieve good outcomes.

Frictions can take a lot of different forms.  For example, it takes time to meet a life partner. Consider a dating website – this is an online institution that helps you meet others. This institution helps mitigate the friction of finding a compatible mate.  They expedite your ability to meet individuals. 
In a market, there are many different kinds of frictions.  As we go through this course, Professor Wright will examine different examples of frictions and the institutions that help mitigate frictions.

How much math is involved in this course? 
Most of the math you will be doing will be found in the homework assignments.  The recommended math background is listed above.

I have little business experience. Will this course be worthwhile to me? 
We discuss banking, credit and households.  The content covered in this course can be generally applied with respect to ones life.  However, many of the examples that Professor Wright uses are related to business in an economic setting.

Will this course address investment strategies in the stock market? 
No, this course will not address investment strategies in the stock market.

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Since antiquity, philosophers have questioned the foundations--the foundations of the physical world, of our everyday experience, of our scientific knowledge, and of culture and society. In recent years, more and more young philosophers have become convinced that, in order to understand these foundations, and thus to make progress in philosophy, the use of mathematical methods is of crucial importance. This is what our course will be concerned with: mathematical philosophy, that is, philosophy done with the help of mathematical methods.

As we will try to show, one can analyze philosophical concepts much more clearly in mathematical terms, one can derive philosophical conclusions from philosophical assumptions by mathematical proof, and one can build mathematical models in which we can study philosophical problems.

So, as Leibniz would have said: even in philosophy, calculemus. Let&#39;s calculate.

Learn how to think the way mathematicians do - a powerful cognitive process developed over thousands of years.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
NOTE: For the Winter 2014 session, the course website will go live at 10:00 AM US-PST on Saturday February 1, two days before the course begins, so you have time to familiarize yourself with the website structure, watch some short introductory videos, and look at some preliminary material.

The goal of the course is to help you develop a valuable mental ability – a powerful way of thinking that our ancestors have developed over three thousand years.
 
Mathematical thinking is not the same as doing mathematics – at least not as mathematics is typically presented in our school system. School math typically focuses on learning procedures to solve highly stereotyped problems. Professional mathematicians think a certain way to solve real problems, problems that can arise from the everyday world, or from science, or from within mathematics itself. The key to success in school math is to learn to think inside-the-box. In contrast, a key feature of mathematical thinking is thinking outside-the-box – a valuable ability in today’s world. This course helps to develop that crucial way of thinking.
 
The course is offered in two versions. The eight-week-long Basic Course is designed for people who want to develop or improve mathematics-based, analytic thinking for professional or general life purposes. The ten-week-long Extended Course is aimed primarily at first-year students at college or university who are thinking of majoring in mathematics or a mathematically-dependent subject, or high school seniors who have such a college career in mind. The final two weeks are more intensive and require more mathematical background than the Basic Course. There is no need to make a formal election between the two. Simply skip or drop out of the final two weeks if you decide you want to complete only the Basic Course.

Recommended Background
High school mathematics. Specific requirements are familiarity with elementary symbolic algebra, the concept of a number system (in particular, the characteristics of, and distinctions between, the natural numbers, the integers, the rational numbers, and the real numbers), and some elementary set theory (including inequalities and intervals of the real line). Students whose familiarity with these topics is somewhat rusty typically find that with a little extra effort they can pick up what is required along the way. The only heavy use of these topics is in the (optional) final two weeks of the Extended Course.

A good way to assess if your basic school background is adequate (even if currently rusty) is to glance at the topics in the book Adding It Up: Helping Children Learn Mathematics (free download), published by the US National Academies Press in 2001. Though aimed at K-8 mathematics teachers and teacher educators, it provides an excellent coverage of what constitutes a good basic mathematics education for life in the Twenty-First Century (which was the National Academies&#39; aim in producing it).
Suggested Readings
There is one reading assignment at the start, providing some motivational background.

There is a supplemental reading unit describing elementary set theory for students who are not familiar with the material.

There is a course textbook, Introduction to Mathematical Thinking, by Keith Devlin, available at low cost (US base price $10.99) from Amazon, in hard copy and Kindle versions, but it is not required in order to complete the course.

For general background on mathematics and its role in the modern world, take a look at the five week survey course on mathematics (&quot;Mathematics: Making the Invisible Visible&quot;) Devlin gave at Stanford in fall 2012, available for free download from iTunes University (Stanford), and on YouTube (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), particularly the first halves of lectures 1 and 4.
Course Format
The Basic Course lasts for eight weeks, comprising ten lectures, each with a problem-based work assignment (ungraded, designed for group work), a weekly Problem Set (machine graded), and weekly tutorials in which the instructor will go over some of the assignment and Problem Set questions from the previous week. 

The Extended Course consists of the Basic Course followed by a more intense two weeks exercise called Test Flight. Whereas the focus in the Basic Course is the development of mathematically-based thinking skills for everyday life, the focus in Test Flight is on applying those skills to mathematics itself. 
FAQ
Will I get a certificate after completing this class?
The course does not carry Stanford credit. If you complete the Basic Course with more than a minimal aggregate mark, you will get a Statement of Accomplishment. If you go on to complete the Extended Course with more than a minimal mark, you will receive a Statement of Accomplishment with Distinction.

What are the assignments for this class?
At the end of each lecture, you will be given an assignment (as a downloadable PDF file, released at the same time as the lecture) that is intended to guide understanding of what you have learned. Worked solutions to problems from the assignments will be described the following week in a video tutorial session given by the instructor.

Using the worked solutions as guidance, together with input from other students, you will self-grade your assignment work for correctness. The assignments are for understanding and development, not for grade points. You are strongly encouraged to discuss your work with others before, during, and after the self-grading process. These assignments (and the self-grading) are the real heart of the course. The only way to learn how to think mathematically is to keep trying to do so, comparing your performance to that of an expert and discussing the issues with fellow students.
Is there a final exam for this course?
No. The Test Flight exercise in the final two weeks of the Extended Course is built around a Problem Set similar to those used throughout the course, and your submission will be peer evaluated by other students, but the focus is on the process of evaluation itself, with the goal of developing the ability to judge mathematical arguments presented by others. Whilst not an exam, Test Flight is an intense and challenging capstone experience, and is designed to prepare students for further study of university level mathematics.

How is this course graded?
In the Basic Course, grades are awarded for the weekly Problem Sets, which are machine graded. The aggregate grade is provided in the cover note to the Statement of Accomplishment, with an explanation of its significance within the class. In the Extended Course, additional grades are awarded for a series of proof evaluation exercises and for the Test Flight Problem Set (peer evaluated). The aggregate grade is provided in the cover note to the Statement of Accomplishment with Distinction, with an explanation of its significance within the class.</field>

The Meat We Eat is a course designed to create a more informed consumer about the quality, safety, healthfulness and sustainability of muscle foods and address current issues in animal agriculture in developed and developing countries.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
The average American is now at least three generations removed from production agriculture.  This leads to the disconnection between how the public views agriculture and how scientists and producers view it, resulting in consumer distrust of science and commercial food production.  It is this lack of trust which leads to consumer confusion and the urge to grasp at multiple solutions.  However a growing number of consumers in developed countries are aspiring to “know where their food comes from”.  Animal agriculture needs to explain the technology which will be used to sustainably feed 9 billion people by 2050.

Lectures will cover all aspects of muscle foods production, processing, preparation, cooking and storage.  Additionally, the role of muscle foods in a balanced diet will be addressed as will issues which contribute to consumers limiting or eliminating meat from their diets.
Course Syllabus
Week 1: U.S. history, production systems, and comparison with international systems

Week 2: Humane slaughter and muscle composition

Week 3: U.S. inspection and food safety

Week 4: U.S. grading, fabrication, bulk purchasing, and packaging

Week 5: Palatability, cooking &amp; processing

Week 6: The healthfulness of meat in the diet, growth promoting technologies &amp; sustainability

Recommended Background
There are no prerequisites for this course; all are welcome to enroll!
Course Format
This six-week class will be composed of weekly lecture videos, additional readings, forum discussions and weekly quizzes.  Additionally, a unique, peer-graded video assignment will allow students to practice the skills learned in this course by preparing and cooking their own meat. All videos must include proper use of a thermometer and must include proper sanitary handling and minimization of cross-contamination.
FAQ
Will I earn a Statement of Accomplishment for this course?

Yes, students who complete the course at a satisfactory level will receive a Statement of Accomplishment. Students may also earn a Statement of Accomplishment with Distinction for uploading the meat cookery video, completing all required discussion board posts and having an average score above 80% on the quizzes.

Explore the structure and function of the human central nervous system. Learn why knowledge of human neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, neural plasticity, and new discovery in the brain sciences matters for clinical practice in the health professions.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Medical Neuroscience explores the organization and physiology of the human central nervous system. This course is designed for first-year students in graduate-level health professions programs. It builds upon knowledge acquired in prior studies of cellular and molecular biology, general physiology, and human anatomy. The course provides students an understanding of the essential principles of neurological function, from cellular and molecular mechanisms of neural signaling and plasticity to the organization and function of sensory and motor systems. This course emphasizes the neural and vascular anatomy of the human brain and spinal cord, providing an anatomical framework for localizing lesions within the central nervous system. It also emphasizes the neurobiological foundation for understanding cognition, mental illness and disorders of human behavior. 

The overall goal is to equip students in the health professions for interpreting impairments of sensation, action and cognition that accompany neurological injury, disease or dysfunction. Students currently pursuing advanced studies in the brain sciences will benefit from this course by learning the fundamentals of functional human neuroanatomy and how neuroscience discovery translates to clinical practice.  Health professionals will benefit from the opportunity to review and update knowledge of foundational medical neuroscience.
Course Syllabus
Topics covered include:
1.  Surface anatomy and internal anatomy of the human brain and spinal cord
2.  Neural signaling and plasticity
3.  Sensory systems
4.  Motor systems
5.  Brain development across the lifespan
6.  Brain basis of cognition
Recommended Background
To be successful in this course, a college-level background in cellular and molecular biology and general knowledge of systems physiology and human anatomy is strongly recommended.
Suggested Readings
Although the course is designed to be self-contained for students with the recommended background, students wanting to expand their knowledge and reinforce their understanding are strongly encouraged to complete all recommended readings.  The primary reference text for this course is Neuroscience, 5th Ed., by Purves et al. (Sinauer Assoc., Inc.).  This text is bundled with neuroanatomical software,  Sylvius 4 Online: An Interactive Atlas and Visual Glossary of Human Neuroanatomy, (also available as a standalone subscription).
Course Format
The course consists of video tutorials delivered by Professor White, a neuroscientist, educator, and course director in the Duke University School of Medicine. Typically, these videos contain 1 or more integrated multiple-choice questions. Regular quizzes and application experiences focused on functional neuroanatomy and problem-solving through clinical case studies will assist students in keeping pace with course content. An exam focused on clinical neuroanatomy will be administered in the final few weeks of the course, and a comprehensive final exam is administered at the conclusion of the course. Learning will be supported by recommended textbook readings and interactive activities using digital atlases of the human brain and spinal cord. Each video tutorial will be accompanied by tutorial notes that will guide learning.
FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment for completing this course?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.

Who should enroll in this course?
You should take this course if you are currently enrolled in a health professions curriculum or are preparing to do so having satisfied the usual prerequisites. This course is designed to provide you with the foundational knowledge you will need in basic neuroscience and clinical neuroanatomy. If you are pursuing advanced studies in the brain sciences or a related biomedical or bioengineering field, then you will take away an understanding of human brain anatomy and insight into how ongoing discovery in neuroscience is shaping clinical practice.  If you are a health professional, this course will provide a productive means for reviewing and updating your knowledge or foundational neuroscience.  Lastly, if you are simply curious about the structure and function of the human brain, but have no aspirations to apply this knowledge in the health or research professions, you too can have an engaging and fulfilling experience, provided that you are willing to commit to all assigned readings, videos, and assessments.

What is the intellectual difficulty of this course?
The intellectual challenge and content level of this course is comparable to what first-year students in the graduate-level health professions would experience.  This is why the course is expected to require 16-20 hours per week of effort.

Is there a required textbook for this course?
You can be successful in this course without acquiring Neuroscience, 5th Ed. However, your experience will be significantly enhanced if you acquire the text and complete all recommended readings and learning activities using the bundled neuroanatomical software.</field>

An introduction to the basics of marine science and conservation, brought to you with the help of sea turtles, marine mammals, seabirds and many more of the most compelling creatures in the ocean.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This course is about sea turtles, whales, dolphins, seals, penguins, sharks, giant squid and other large ocean creatures - collectively known as marine megafauna - and what they can tell us about how the ocean works and why it is so important for all life on earth. 

This course will help you learn about life in the ocean, how ocean ecosystems function, how scientists study the ocean, and the challenges we face in sustaining healthy oceans for the future. These topics will be explored using case studies that focus on charismatic marine megafauna species – the most compelling creatures in the ocean that capture our attention and inspire us to learn more. 

The course starts with an examination of the physical dimensions of the world’s ocean and how we describe ocean zones based on the ecosystems found within them. Once these basics are covered, we will work through the evolution of life in the oceans and explore how marine animals have adapted to the challenges of a cold, dark and deep ocean. Throughout the class we will highlight how scientists study the oceans and the animals that live in them, providing glimpses of new technologies that boost our understanding of marine ecology. The course will also cover some of the challenges the oceans face due to human activities - exploring issues such as bycatch and climate change - and how they are affecting ocean species and systems.


Throughout the course we will connect with real marine science through the use of open access scientific articles published in the journal PLOS ONE. This means you will have to learn how to read scientific papers and extract the important bits of information from them. The articles you’ll be reading are all part of a new PLOS Collection focused on using open access research to teach marine science and conservation. You will also get to look at real datasets produced by scientists studying marine creatures and visualize them in freely available programs such as Google Earth.

	<field name="course_intro">The Social Context of Mental Health and Illness
Learn how social factors promote mental health, influence the onset and course of mental illness, and affect how mental illnesses are diagnosed and treated.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Mental health and mental illness used to be something that people didn’t talk about, but now it seems every time we open a newspaper we are hearing about the importance of mental health, or the consequences of mental illness. At this point in our history we understand mental illness and mental health to be largely influenced by biological factors, specifically, workings of the brain. At the same time, we have always known that social factors play a very strong role in promoting mental health and can make big differences in who gets mentally ill, who gets treated for mental illness, and how people can achieve good quality of life after a mental health diagnosis. 

This course is an opportunity to explore how social practices and ideas contribute to the ways in which society, families and individuals are affected by mental health and mental illness. We will look at issues like why some people think mental illness is a myth, how people think about mental health and illness in different cultures, who gets mentally ill and why, how families are affected by mental illness and what interventions are available to treat mental illness and promote mental health.

	<field name="course_intro">Metadata: Organizing and Discovering Information
Metadata is an unsung hero of the modern world, the plumbing that makes the information age possible. This course describes how Metadata is used as an information tool for the Web, for databases, and for the software and computing applications around us.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
If you use nearly any digital technology, you make use of metadata. Use an ATM today? You interacted with metadata about your account. Searched for songs in iTunes or Spotify? You used metadata about those songs. We use and even create metadata constantly, but we rarely realize it. Metadata -- or data about data -- describes real and digital objects, so that those objects may be organized now and found later. 

Metadata is a tool that enables the information age functions performed by humans as well as those performed by computers. Metadata is important to many fields, particularly Computer Science; but this course is not purely a Computer Science course. This course approaches Metadata from the perspective of Information Science, which is a broad interdisciplinary field that studies how people create and manage information. 
Course Syllabus
Unit 1: Organizing Information 
Unit 2: Dublin Core 
Unit 3: How to Build a Metadata Schema 
Unit 4: Alphabet Soup: Metadata Schemas That You (Will) Know and Love 
Unit 5: Metadata for the Web 
Unit 6: Metadata for Networks 
Unit 7: How to Create Metadata 
Unit 8: How to Evaluate Metadata
Recommended Background
Knowledge of HTML or HTML5 is a prerequisite for this course. If you are unsure if you meet this prerequsite, we recommend that you score at least 15 out of 20 on the W3Schools’ HTML Quiz. If you find that you do not have this level of knowledge of HTML, many free online resources are available, including: 
W3Schools’ HTML Tutorial
Codecademy’s Web Fundamentals Track
Suggested Readings
Metadata is central to Information Science -- without metadata, there would likely be no Information Science. Consequently, a lot has been written about metadata. These are just a few of the many resources available.

Some good books (which are not required for this course) are: 
Introduction to Metadata: Second Edition, by Murtha Baca
Metadata in Practice, by Diane I. Hillmann [publisher] [Chegg]
Metadata, by Marcia Lei Zeng &amp; Jian Qin [publisher] [Amazon]
The Discipline of Organizing, by Robert J. Glushko [publisher] [Amazon]
Some other useful online resources are:
Understanding Metadata, by the National Information Standards Organization
Course Format
This course will be 8 weeks long, each week dealing with a new topic. Each topic will consist of brief video lectures and demos, about 2 hours of total video per week. There will be occasional interviews with experts on various aspects of Metadata. Most videos will contain brief quizzes, to help students evaluate their own understanding. A graded test will be due each week, and a final exam will be included at the end of the course. Peer-graded assessments may be incorporated in the assignments.
FAQ
Will there be a required textbook?
No. Readings will be selected from freely available articles, web content and open access scholarly literature.

Will a Statement of Accomplishment be awarded?
Students who complete all graded assignments and achieve at least 80% overall will receive a Statement of Accomplishment.

What’s the time commitment for this course?
Watching the videos, completing the readings, and completing the graded weekly assignments will require a minimum time commitment of approximately 4-6 hours per week.</field>

Why 3 Versions?
Note: In January 2014 we will offer 3 versions of this course so that you can choose a version that best meets your needs. Two of the versions are identical except for the duration of the course. The third version is both shorter and covers slightly less material, focusing on just the most critical aspects of microeconomics principles. See further below for more details about the differences.

About the Course
Most people make the incorrect assumption that economics is ONLY the study of money.  My primary goal in this course is to shatter this belief.  In fact, in the last 50 years economists have tackled some of the most interesting and important questions for humanity.  For instance, the following are just a few examples:

About Love and Marriage
Why is the divorce rate so high and what should we do in order to reduce it?
About the Environment
Why do we have so much pollution?
How much is an endangered species worth?
About Crime
Would legalizing marijuana lead to a reduction in crime?
About Labor Markets
Does increasing the Federal Minimum Wage put people out of work?
Why did so many women enter the labor force during the last 40 years?
About things you should be worrying about
Why is a college education a smart investment? Or isn&#39;t?
Why are the presidential candidates missing the point on college costs?
And about many other things:
Would school vouchers lead to improvements in public education?
Why a draft would only damage the army?
How to level the playing field in baseball?
AND, why is COURSERA offering this course free of charge?
Additional questions we will consider:

What economists do and the strange way they think? (Basic Concepts, Modeling and Trade)
What determines prices and quantity in a market economy? (Supply and Demand)
What is the relationship between free market economies and social welfare? (Market Efficiency and Government Intervention)
What are the distributional effects of taxes? (Elasticity and Taxes)
What is the relationship between production and costs in a firm? (Production and Costs)
How competitive firms choose their efficient level of output? (Competitive Output)
What are the pricing policies of firms with some degree of market power? (Firms With Market Power)
How much pollution is too much pollution? (Public Goods, Common Resources and Externalities)
We will be addressing many of these (and many more) questions during this course. Again, my main goal will to show you the way economists think and how to use this analytical system to answer questions related not only to these and other important human issues but pretty much to anything you end up doing with your life after this class. After all, as you will quickly find out, I believe everything is economics!

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting them to work for yourself. More importantly, you&#39;ll learn about not only the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new problems. Finally, you&#39;ll learn about some of Silicon Valley&#39;s best practices in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI.

This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you&#39;ll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.

FAQ
What is the format of the class?
The class will consist of lecture videos, which are broken into small chunks, usually between eight and twelve minutes each. Some of these may contain integrated quiz questions. There will also be standalone quizzes that are not part of video lectures, and programming assignments.

How much programming background is needed for the course?
The course includes programming assignments and some programming background will be helpful.

Do I need to buy a textbook for the course?
No, it is self-contained.

Will I get a statement of accomplishment after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a statement of accomplishment signed by the instructor.</field>

Part of the &quot;Mobile Cloud Computing with Android&quot; Specialization »
In this course----the third in a trans-institution sequence of MOOCs on Mobile Cloud Computing with Android--we will learn how to connect Android mobile devices to cloud computing and data storage resources, essentially turning a device into an extension of powerful cloud-based services on popular cloud computing platforms, such as Google App Engine and Amazon EC2.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This MOOC describes by example how to connect Android mobile devices to clouds via the use of object-oriented design techniques, Java programming language features, Jetty middleware, Java Servlets, the Java Spring Framework, and cloud computing platforms, such as Google App Engine. 

An extended case study project will be used throughout the MOOC to showcase architectures for communicating with the cloud using HTTP, server-side processing of mobile data using servlets and the Java Spring Framework, and scalable storage of data using no-SQL databases and other platforms. 

Because of the importance of building secure and scalable mobile/cloud platforms, this MOOC will not only show you how to program handheld systems that talk to the cloud, but how to do so securely, scalably, and efficiently. Security and scalability topics will be woven into discussions of cloud service creation so that students learn, from the start, how to create robust cloud services for mobile devices.  

Although the cloud service topics in this course will be taught in the context of connecting mobile devices to the cloud, the concepts are broader and will give students the ability to create the cloud services to support large-scale web applications, such as social networking applications; cloud services for embedded systems, such as the Internet of Things and Industrial Internet; and wearable computing devices, such as Google Glass. 

Note: This course is part of a trans-institution sequence of MOOCs entitled Mobile Cloud Computing with Android

This MOOC and two others, taught by Dr. Adam Porter from the University of Maryland and Dr. Douglas C. Schmidt from Vanderbilt University, have been designed to complement one another as part of the first trans-institution Specialization taught on the Coursera platform. Some of the programming assignments and the course project for these MOOCs will be coordinated. Dr. Porter&#39;s MOOC, Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems, will be taught first; it focuses on the design and programming of user-facing application components. Dr. Schmidt&#39;s MOOC, Programming Mobile Services for Android Handheld Systems, will be taught next; it focuses on middleware systems programming topics, such as synchronous and asynchronous concurrency models, background service processing, structured data management, local inter-process communication and networking. This MOOC introduces the concepts and knowledge needed to connect the user-facing and service-based components, built in the first two courses, to the cloud. 

If you just want to take some of the MOOCs in this sequence or take them all in different order you’re certainly welcome to do so, and you’ll still learn a lot. If you take all the MOOCs in this sequence in the order presented, however, you’ll gain a deeper, end-to-end understanding of handheld systems, their applications and services, as well as their integration into the cloud.

Course Syllabus
The course is organized into the following parts:
Section 0: Overview of all the topics covered in this part of the course, which helps you visualize the motivations for--and challenges of--building scalable cloud services to support mobile, embedded, and web applications on cloud computing platforms, such as  Google App Engine and Amazon EC2.
Section 1: Applying patterns and frameworks to develop scalable and secure cloud services, which uses an open-source cloud service as a running example to illustrate patterns and frameworks pertaining to service access, mobile/cloud communication, request routing, session handling, data persistence, concurrency and synchronization, synchronous and asynchronous event handling, and security. The bulk of the examples are in Java using the Spring Framework and Jetty middleware platform. The examples can be run on Google App Engine and Amazon EC2.

The PDF and PowerPoint versions of all the slides used in the course will be available online as the videos become available on the course website.

Recommended Background
Ideally, students who take this course will be familiar with general object-oriented design and programming concepts (such as encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism, extensibility ), fundamental Java object-oriented programming language features (such as classes, inheritance, interfaces, and generics available in Java, basic systems programming concepts (such as event handling, processes/threads, synchronization), and networking terminology (such as client/server and peer-to-peer architectures).  
Suggested Readings
Although the lectures are designed to be largely self-contained, it&#39;s recommended (but not required) that students refer to the following books:
Martin Fowler, Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code, Addison-Wesley Professional, 1999.
Goetz et al., Java Concurrency in Practice, Addison-Wesley, 2006.

Much of this material is available online.
Course Format
The class will consist of lecture videos with integrated quiz questions designed to ensure you understand the material covered in the videos.  In recognition that not all participants have the same learning objectives or available time, the course is offered at two levels of engagement: 
  
NormalTrack – Estimated Time Commitment:  3 – 5 Hours Per Week 
Students at this level receive a Statement of Accomplishment that certifies advanced proficiency with the course concepts, which will be assessed by weekly auto-graded standalone quizzes.  This track is designed for those who wish to engage the material by doing the auto-graded quizzes, final exam, and participating in the online discussion forums, but who may not have the time/interest to complete the auto-/peer-graded programming assignments. 
  
DistinctionTrack – Estimated Time Commitment: 5 – 7 Hours Per Week 
Students at this level will receive a Statement of Accomplishment with Distinction that certifies greater mastery of the practice of the course content.  In addition to completing the auto-graded weekly quizzes and final exam from the Standard Track, students in this track will also complete auto-/peer-graded programming assignments. The programming assignments will involve writing cloud services using popular software frameworks written in Java, such as Spring Framework. This track is designed for those students wishing to achieve mastery of the course material and to understand its application in realistic project context. 
FAQ
 What are the course objectives?
Upon completing this course, students should be able to:

Build cloud services that can support mobile, embedded, or web-based clients.
Identify security concerns related to client-provided data and common programming flaws that lead to insecure services.
Apply key pattern-oriented software architecture techniques to develop reusable concurrent and networked cloud services using the Java object-oriented programming language, Servlets, and the Spring Framework.
Develop Android components to communicate with the cloud and design/implement application-level protocols on top of HTTP.
Implement data persistence components for cloud services and understand scalability issues with varying architectures
Know where to find additional sources of information on how to build secure and scalable cloud services for mobile devices, embedded systems, and web applications.
What is a &quot;trans-institutional sequence of MOOCs&quot;?
This MOOC and two other MOOCs called Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems, which is taught by Professor Adam Porter from the University of Maryland, and Programming Mobile Services for Android Handheld Systems, which is taught by Professor Douglas C. Schmidt, have been designed to complement each other. In particular, some of the programming assignments and the course project for both courses will be coordinated. Professor Porter&#39;s will focus on the design and programming of user-facing applications, and will be taught first, starting in January 2014. Professor Schmidt&#39;s MOOC will focus on middleware systems programming topics, such as synchronous and asynchronous concurrency models, background service processing, management of structured data, and local inter-process communication and networking, and will be taught second, starting in April 2014. Additional information on our trans-institutional MOOC sequence is available here and here.

Is it necessary to take Prof. Porter or Prof. Schmidt&#39;s MOOC prior to this MOOC or can students take this MOOC without taking his course?
You can take the course without the other two courses in the sequence. If you just want to take some of the courses in this sequence--or take them all in different order--you&#39;re certainly welcome to do so, and you&#39;ll still learn a lot. However, if you take all the courses in this sequence in the order presented you&#39;ll gain a deeper, end-to-end understanding of handheld systems, their applications and services, as well as their integration into the cloud.

When will the course material be made available each week? All the course material (e.g., video lectures, quizzes, short essays, programming assignments, etc.), for each week will be made available at 9am eastern time (2pm UTC/GMT).
How does this MOOC compare/contrast with courses at Vanderbilt?
This MOOC is heavily based on courses we teach at Vanderbilt, such as the course Principles of Software Engineering. The course lecture material is similar. The quizzes, programming assignments, and level of feedback for the Vanderbilt courses are different, however, since the courses at Vanderbilt have many fewer students, so there&#39;s significantly more personalized guidance from the professor and TAs that can&#39;t (yet) be replicated via a MOOC.

Can students use programming language [X] for the course?
The programming assignments in this course are designed for the Java programming language.  Although you&#39;re welcome to use other languages to implement the cloud services, if you stray from Java you&#39;ll have more work to do to map what we&#39;re covering in the videos and projects to the languages you want to use. You may also find it hard to get feedback on your work via the Coursera peer-grading system .

Will there be a Statement of Accomplishment for students who complete this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the quizzes and assignments in this class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.  There will be two levels of Statements of Accomplishment: Normal Track and Distinction Track. The difference between these two tracks is covered at the Coursera website for this MOOC.

What is the most effective way to learn material covered in the course?
We recommend watching the videos multiple times, looking for different levels of meaning in the diagrams and the examples. Likewise, we recommend reading any papers referenced in the lectures, as well as material from the (optional) recommended reading. Naturally, participating in the online discussion forum (and ideally, a meetup group if one is available in your area) will help make the course material more engaging.

Can students take this course if they have no prior experience with Android programming or programming with Java?
Our course assumes that students are comfortable programming in Java and have some experience programming Android apps. If you don&#39;t have any significant Java programming background we recommend that you first take the Creative, Serious and Playful Science of Android Apps MOOC, which is a novice-friendly introduction to computer science and programming Android-apps for smart-phones and tablets. No prior programming knowledge is necessary for that MOOC. Likewise, we also recommend that you take Professor Adam Porter&#39;s MOOC Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems since his course provides important coverage of Android app programming that will be useful in our course.

 Is there a required textbook?
There is no required textbook, per se. There&#39;s lots of information available in the videos, slides, and the URLs mentioned in the slides that will help you learn the material we cover in this class. For deeper mastery of the material, however, please see the list of &quot;recommended reading&quot; on the course webpage for a list of books that are closely related to the topics of the course.

Where can students learn about how to configure a Java development environment to complete the programming assignments?
The videos from Professor Porter&#39;s MOOC Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems provide step-by-step instructions on how to setup an Android development environment using Eclipse and Java. Eclipse will be the primary development environment used in this course. Videos will be provided on how to setup the Eclipse plug-in for Google App Engine.  If you&#39;re using a non-Eclipse development environment (such as Intellij IDEA) you&#39;ll need to enlist the help of other students on the online discussion forum.

	<field name="course_intro">Everything is the Same: Modeling Engineered Systems
This introduction to engineering course will help you learn modeling and analysis techniques for electrical, mechanical, and chemical systems and discover how engineered systems that seem very different are actually very similar.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Students in this class will learn modeling and analysis techniques applicable to electrical, mechanical, and chemical systems.  This “systems” view, that focuses on what is common to these different physical systems, has been responsible for much of the progress in the last several decades in aeronautics, robotics, and other engineering disciplines where there are many different technologies working together.  

Starting with algebraic descriptions of individual components (such as resistors), the class develops tools for modeling engineered systems.  Differential equations are key ingredients, so we will spend significant time learning how to derive differential equations from component descriptions.  One of the key ideas in this class is that electrical, mechanical, and chemical systems may seem very different from each other but often have very similar behavior, allowing us to draw powerful analogies between them.  Case studies from several areas of engineering will be used to illustrate the modeling techniques, including examples from robotics, power networks, exoskeletons, biomechanics, system identification, and active sensing.  Students will be encouraged to do hands-on experiments that demonstrate the techniques.

Preview Lectures</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
We live in a complex world with diverse people, firms, and governments whose behaviors aggregate to produce novel, unexpected phenomena. We see political uprisings, market crashes, and a never ending array of social trends. How do we make sense of it? Models. Evidence shows that people who think with models consistently outperform those who don&#39;t. And, moreover people who think with lots of models outperform people who use only one. Why do models make us better thinkers? Models help us to better organize information - to make sense of that fire hose or hairball of data (choose your metaphor) available on the Internet. Models improve our abilities to make accurate forecasts. They help us make better decisions and adopt more effective strategies. They even can improve our ability to design institutions and procedures. In this class, I present a starter kit of models: I start with models of tipping points. I move on to cover models explain the wisdom of crowds, models that show why some countries are rich and some are poor, and models that help unpack the strategic decisions of firm and politicians. The models covered in this class provide a foundation for future social science classes, whether they be in economics, political science, business, or sociology. Mastering this material will give you a huge leg up in advanced courses. They also help you in life. Here&#39;s how the course will work. For each model, I present a short, easily digestible overview lecture. Then, I&#39;ll dig deeper. I&#39;ll go into the technical details of the model. Those technical lectures won&#39;t require calculus but be prepared for some algebra. For all the lectures, I&#39;ll offer some questions and we&#39;ll have quizzes and even a final exam. If you decide to do the deep dive, and take all the quizzes and the exam, you&#39;ll receive a certificate of completion. If you just decide to follow along for the introductory lectures to gain some exposure that&#39;s fine too. It&#39;s all free. And it&#39;s all here to help make you a better thinker!

Course Syllabus
This course will consist of twenty sections. As the course proceeds, I will fill in the descriptions of the topics and put in readings.

Section 1: Introduction: Why Model?
In these lectures, I describe some of the reasons why a person would want to take a modeling course. These reasons fall into four broad categories:

To be an intelligent citizen of the world
To be a clearer thinker
To understand and use data
To better decide, strategize, and design
There are two readings for this section. These should be read either after the first video or at the completion of all of the videos.

The Model Thinker: Prologue, Introduction and Chapter 1

Why Model? by Joshua Epstein

Section 2: Sorting and Peer Effects
We now jump directly into some models. We contrast two types of models that explain a single phenomenon, namely that people tend to live and interact with people who look, think, and act like themselves. After an introductory lecture, we cover famous models by Schelling and Granovetter that cover these phenomena. We follows those with a fun model about standing ovations that I wrote with my friend John Miller.

In this second section, I show a computational version of Schelling&#39;s Segregation Model using NetLogo. Netlogo is free software authored by Uri Wilensky or Northwestern University. I will be using NetLogo several times during the course. It can be downloaded here:

NetLogo

The Schelling Model that I use can be found by clicking on the &quot;File&quot; tab, then going to &quot;Models Library&quot;. In the Models Library directory, click on the arrow next to the Social Science folder and then scroll down and click on the model called Segregation.

The readings for this section include some brief notes on Schelling&#39;s model and then the academic papers of Granovetter and Miller and Page. I&#39;m not expecting you to read those papers from start to end, but I strongly encourage you to peruse them so that you can see how social scientists frame and interpret models.

Section 3: Aggregation
In this section, we explore the mysteries of aggregation, i.e. adding things up. We start by considering how numbers aggregate, focusing on the Central Limit Theorem. We then turn to adding up rules. We consider the Game of Life and one dimensional cellular automata models. Both models show how simple rules can combine to produce interesting phenomena. Last, we consider aggregating preferences. Here we see how individual preferences can be rational, but the aggregates need not be.

There exist many great places on the web to read more about the Central Limit Theorem, the Binomial Distribution, Six Sigma, The Game of LIfe, and so on. I&#39;ve included some links to get you started. The readings for cellular automata and for diverse preferences are short excerpts from my books Complex Adaptive Social Systems and The Difference Respectively.

Section 4: Decision Models
In this section, we study some models of how people make decisions. We start by considering multi criterion decision making. We then turn to spatial models of decision making and then decision trees. We conclude by looking at the value of information..

The reading for multi-criterion decision making will be my guide for the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative. It provides a case study for how to use this technique. For spatial voting and decision models, there exist many great power point presentations and papers on the web. The Decision Tree writings are from Arizona State University&#39;s Craig Kirkwood.

Section 5: Models of People: Thinking Electrons
In this section, we study various ways that social scientists model people. We study and contrast three different models. The rational actor approach,behavioral models , and rule based models . These lectures provide context for many of the models that follow. There&#39;s no specific reading for these lectures though I mention several books on behavioral economics that you may want to consider. Also, if you find the race to the bottom game interesting just type &quot;Rosemary Nagel Race to the Bottom&quot; into a search engine and you&#39;ll get several good links. You can also find good introductions to &quot;Zero Intelligence Traders&quot; by typing that in as well.

Here is a link to a brief primer on behavioral economics that has more references.

Short Primer on Behavioral Economics

Section 6: Linear Models
In this section, we cover linear models. We start by looking at categorical models, in which data gets binned into categories. We use this simple framework to introduce measures like mean, variance, and R-squared. We then turn to linear models describing what linear models do, how to read regression output (a valuable skill!) and how to fit nonlinear data with linear models. These lectures are meant to give you a &quot;feel&quot; for how linear models are used and perhaps to motivate you to take a course on these topics. I conclude this section by highlighting a distinction between what I call Big Coefficient thinking and New Reality thinking. The readings for this section consist of two short pieces written by me, but you can find abundant resources on the web on linear models, R-squared, regression, and evidence based thinking.

Categorical Models

Linear Models

Section 7: Tipping Points
In this section, we cover tipping points. We focus on two models. A percolation model from physics that we apply to banks and a model of the spread of diseases. The disease model is more complicated so I break that into two parts. The first part focuses on the diffusion. The second part adds recovery. The readings for this section consist of two excerpts from the book I&#39;m writing on models. One covers diffusion. The other covers tips. There is also a technical paper on tipping points that I&#39;ve included in a link. I wrote it with PJ Lamberson and it will be published in the Quarterly Journal of Political Science. I&#39;ve included this to provide you a glimpse of what technical social science papers look like. You don&#39;t need to read it in full, but I strongly recommend the introduction. It also contains a wonderful reference list.

Section 8: Economic Growth
In this section, we cover several models of growth. We start with a simple model of exponential growth and then move on to models from economics, with a focus on Solow&#39;s basic growth model. I simplify the model by leaving out the labor component. These models help us distinguish between two types of growth: growth that occurs from capital accumulation and growth that occurs from innovation.

Growth Models

Section 9: Diversity and Innovation
In this section, we cover some models of problem solving to show the role that diversity plays in innovation. We see how diverse perspectives (problem representations) and heuristics enable groups of problem solvers to outperform individuals. We also introduce some new concepts like &quot;rugged landscapes&quot; and &quot;local optima&quot;. In the last lecture, we&#39;ll see the awesome power of recombination and how it contributes to growth. The readings for this chapters consist on an excerpt from my book The Difference courtesy of Princeton University Press.

Diversity and Problem Solving

Section 10: Markov Processes
In this section, we cover Markov Processes. Markov Processes capture dynamic processes between a fixed set of states. For example, we will consider a process in which countries transition between democratic and dictatorial. To be a Markov Process, it must be possible to get from any one state to any other and the probabilities of moving between states must remain fixed over time. If those assumptions hold, then the process will have a unique equilibrium. In other words, history will not matter. Formally, this result is called the Markov Convergence Theorem. In addition to covering Markov Processes, we will also see how the basic framework can be used in other applications such as determining authorship of a text and the efficacy of a drug protocol.

Markov Processes

Section 11: Lyapunov Functions
Models can help us to determine the nature of outcomes produced by a system: will the system produce an equilibrium, a cycle, randomness, or complexity? In this set of lectures, we cover Lyapunov Functions. These are a technique that will enable us to identify many systems that go to equilibrium. In addition, they enable us to put bounds on how quickly the equilibrium will be attained. In this set of lectures, we learn the formal definition of Lyapunov Functions and see how to apply them in a variety of settings. We also see where they don&#39;t apply and even study a problem where no one knows whether or not the system goes to equilibrium or not.

Lyapunov Functions

Section 12: Coordination and Culture
In this set of lectures, we consider some models of culture. We begin with some background on what culture is and why it&#39;s so important to social scientists. In the analytic section, we begin with a very simple game called the pure coordination game In this game, the players win only if they choose the same action. Which action they choose doesn&#39;t matter -- so long as they choose the same one. For example, whether you drive on the left or the right side of the road is not important, but what is important is that you drive on the same side as everyone else. We then consider situations in which people play multiple coordination games and study the emergence of culture. In our final model, we include a desire consistency as well as coordination in a model that produces the sorts of cultural signatures seen in real world data. The readings for this section include some of my notes on coordination games and then the Bednar et al academic paper. In that paper, you see how we used Markov Processes to study the model. There is also a link to the Axelrod Net Logo Model.

Coordination Games

Section 13: Path Dependence

In this set of lectures, we cover path dependence. We do so using some very simple urn models. The most famous of which is the Polya Process. These models are very simple but they enable us to unpack the logic of what makes a process path dependent. We also relate path dependence to increasing returns and to tipping points. The reading for this lecture is a paper that I wrote that is published in the Quarterly Journal of Political Science

Path Dependence

Section 14: Networks

In this section, we cover networks. We discuss how networks form, their structure -- in particular some common measures of networks -- and their function. Often, networks exhibit functions that emerge, but that we mean that no one intended for the functionality but it arises owing to the structure of the network. The reading for this section is a short article by Steven Strogatz.

Strogatz

Section 15:Randomness and Random Walks

In this section, we first discuss randomness and its various sources. We then discuss how performance can depend on skill and luck, where luck is modeled as randomness. We then learn a basic random walk model, which we apply to the Efficient Market Hypothesis, the ideas that market prices contain all relevant information so that what&#39;s left is randomness. We conclude by discussing finite memory random walk model that can be used to model competition. The reading for this section is a paper on distinguishing skill from luck by Michael Mauboussin.
Mauboussin: Skill vs Luck

Section 16: The Colonel Blotto Game

In this section, we cover the Colonel Blotto Game. This game was originally developed to study war on multiple fronts. It&#39;s now applied to everything from sports to law to terrorism. We will discuss the basics of Colonel Blotto, move on to some more advanced analysis and then contrast Blotto with our skill luck model from the previous section. The readings for this section are an excerpt from my book The Difference and a paper that I wrote with Russell Golman of Carnegie Mellon. You need only read the first four pages of the Golman paper.

Blotto from The Difference

Golman Page: General Blotto

Section 17:The Prisoners&#39; Dilemma and Collective Action

In this section, we cover the Prisoners&#39; Dilemma, Collective Action Problems and Common Pool Resource Problems. We begin by discussion the Prisoners&#39; Dilemma and showing how individual incentives can produce undesirable social outcomes. We then cover seven ways to produce cooperation. Five of these will be covered in the paper by Nowak and Sigmund listed below. We conclude by talking about collective action and common pool resource problems and how they require deep careful thinking to solve. There&#39;s a wonderful piece to read on this by the Nobel Prize winner Elinor Ostrom

The Prisoners&#39; Dilemma in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy

Nowak and Sigmund: Five Ways to Cooperate

Ostrom: Going Beyond Panaceas

Section 18: Mechanism Design: Auctions

In this section, we cover mechanism design. We begin with some of the basics: how to overcome problems of hidden action and hidden information. We then turn to the more applied question of how to design auctions. We conclude by discussion how one can use mechanisms to make decisions about public projects. The readings for this section consist of a piece by the Eric Maskin who won a Nobel Prize for his work on mechanism design and some slides on auctions by V.S. Subrahmanian. The Maskin article can be tough sledding near the end. Don&#39;t worry about necessarily understanding everything. Focus on the big picture that he describes.

Maskin: Mechanism Design

V.S. Subrahmanian&#39;s auction slides

Section 19: Learning: Replicator Dynamics

In this section, we cover replicator dynamics and Fisher&#39;s fundamental theorem. Replicator dynamics have been used to explain learning as well as evolution. Fisher&#39;s theorem demonstrates how the rate of adaptation increases with the amount of variation. We conclude by describing how to make sense of both Fisher&#39;s theorem and our results on six sigma and variation reduction. The readings for this section are very short. The second reading on Fisher&#39;s theorem is rather technical. Both are excerpts from Diversity and Complexity

The Replicator Equation

Fisher&#39;s Theorem

Section 20: The Many Model Thinker: Diversity and Prediction

In our final section, we cover the value of ability and diversity to create wise crowds when making predictions. We start off by talking about category models and linear models and how they can be used to make predictions. We then cover the Diversity Prediction Theorem, which provides basic intuition for how collective prediction works. We conclude by talking about the value of having lots of models. The reading for this section is a short explanation of the diversity prediction theorem.

Diversity Prediction Theorem

Recommended Background
Students should be very comfortable with basic algebra.  Calculus isn’t necessary but a conceptual understanding of how derivatives give the slope at a point  proves useful.

Course Format
The class will cover a variety of models. For each model, I will give an introductory lecture accessible to a general audience that last approximately ten minutes. I will follow this with advanced lectures that explain how model&#39;s details and how to use it, as well as possible extensions. Many of these more detailed lectures will include integrated questions so you can test your knowledge of the material. I will also offer quizzes separate from the video lectures. I anticipate covering two models per week and recording approximately one hour of video per model.

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This course will discuss the emergence of the modern Middle East from the fall of the Ottoman Empire, at the end of the First World War to the present. It will discuss the Ottoman legacy in the region and the Western imperial impact on the creation of the Arab state system. The course will discuss the rise and retreat of Arab nationalism, the problems of internal cohesion of the Arab states, issues of religion and state, and the evolution of Islamist politics. It will also focus on the evolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict and its impact on the region and will conclude with an in depth analysis of the “Arab Spring” by placing these contemporary revolutionary events in their historical context.
Course Syllabus
Week One: 
In our first lesson, we will locate the Middle East in time and space. We will get to know the 19th-century Middle East, the structure of its society and economy as well as the dynamics of its politics. We will then look into the dramatic change that took place in the last quarter of the 18th century, that is the widening gap between Europe and the Middle East as we will dwell on the impact this change had on the future of the region. We will conclude our first lesson with a discussion on the &quot;Eastern Question,&quot; which refers to the fate of the Ottoman Empire and the balance of power in Europe.

Week Two: 
Our second lesson is a discussion on the forces of modernity and tradition in the Middle East. The filtering of European ideas into the Middle East engendered a process of reform in the region throughout much of the 19th century. We will analyse two centers of reform in this respect, namely the Ottoman Empire and Egypt. This analysis will take us next to the Islamic responses to the crisis of modernity as a result of the inherent tension between faith and secularism. We will see how various Islamic thinkers tried to find a compromise between these obvious tensions and at times went in more fundamentalist directions.

Week Three: 
In lesson three, we will witness the rise of nationalism in the Middle East, as it became a much more acceptable idea in the late 19th and early 20th century among an intellectual, elitist, urban minority, who were the graduates of western-style schools (remember lesson two and the process of reform!). We will concentrate on the emergence and development of three nationalist movements; Turkish, Egyptian and Arab. Lastly, we will speak about the First World War and how it brought the end of the Ottoman Empire as well as the end of 400 years of Ottoman Turkish rule in the Arab countries. We will also see how the Middle East began to take its current shape following the First World War.

Week Four: 
In our fourth lesson, we will be speaking about the creation of the Middle East state system in accordance with British and French designs after the First World War. First, we will discuss Egypt and how its distinct historical development gave way to a unique liberal experiment in Egypt during the 1920s and 1930s and consequently to a steady shift toward Islam and Arab nationalism. Second, we will discuss the area of the Fertile Crescent in comparison to Egypt and the creation of British (Palestine, Trans-Jordan, Iraq) and French mandates (Syria, Greater Lebanon) in this region. Our attention will then shift to the non-Arab states. We will learn about the creation of the Republic of Turkey on the ruins of the Ottoman Empire and the sweeping process of modernizing reform under Mustafa Kemal. Lastly, we will take a look at Iran, which was, like Turkey, not a new state created by the Great Powers but a country with a long history and cultural tradition. Our discussion on Iran will include an overview of its history from early 16th century onward as well as the basic principles of the Shi&#39;a which shaped greatly the political culture in Iran.

Week Five: 
In lesson five, we will concentrate on the beginnings of the Arab-Israeli conflict. We will first look into the European context, which gave rise to the emergence of Zionism and the gradual immigration of Jews to Palestine. The Arab response to the Zionist challenge will be discussed next. We will witness the growing hostility between the two populations and the ensuing Arab revolt, the most significant Aran opposition until then. In the background of this heightened tension and the new dynamics introduced by the outbreak of the Second World War, we will focus our attention next on the solutions offered to solve the festering problem, that is the partition plan. 

Week Six: 
Our focus on the sixth lesson will be the period of revolutionary politics in various key Arab states after they gained their political independence. First, we will look into Egypt and the period of faltering modernization which led in the 1930s to an era of Islamic revival (Muslim Brotherhood). What will follow next is the dramatic change which occurred in Egypt with the 

1952 military coup. We will discuss the new path Egypt took with the end of the monarchy, its state policies as well as its foreign policy orientation. Second, we will turn our attention to Iraq, the first of the mandated countries to achieve independence. We will discuss Iraq&#39;s historical development from the overthrow of the Hashemites to the rise of Saddam Hussein. Our discussion topics here will include the Iran-Iraq War and the Kurdish opposition to the Ba&#39;athi regime in Iraq. Next, we will delve into Syrian politics in an effort to understand its prolonged instability with an emphasis on the political meaning of the division between urban Sunni-notables and Syria&#39;s Alawi minority. Fourth, we will speak about Lebanon, its various religious and ethnic communities and how the struggle over power among them led to civil war. As opposed to the instability we have so far discussed in countries like Syria and Lebanon, we will discuss the reasons behind the surprising stability of the monarchies in Jordan and Saudi Arabia next focusing on the components of their durability. 

 Week Seven: 
Our seventh lesson is part one of our discussion on the escalation and de-escalation of the Arab-Israeli conflict from 1948 to 1973. First, we will be looking into the principles of Israel&#39;s security doctrine, which shaped its course of action in the conflict with its neighbours. We will then speak about the Suez Crisis of 1956 not only in its regional context but also in the context of Cold War politics. Second, we will focus on the revival of the Palestinian identity by a collective Arab effort and the establishment of the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization). We will discuss next how Israel and the Arab states came in conflict once again, which resulted in the outbreak of the Six-Day War in 1967. In post-1967 era, we will speak about an inner-Arab conflict between the PLO and the Jordanian monarchy, which resulted in the expulsion of the former from Jordan. Our last topic will be the War of Attrition, during which Egypt and Israel once again came into conflict in a prolonged fight.

 

Week Eight:
Our eight lesson is part two of our discussion on the escalation and de-escalation of the Arab-Israeli conflict, covering the period from 1973 to the present. The Yom Kippur War (also known as the October War) between Israel and the coalition of Arab states will be our first topic of discussion. We will focus next on the 1982 Lebanon War and the subsequent Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon followed by a discussion on the underlying reasons for the outbreak of the First Palestinian Intifada. We will then discuss the peace process that was set in motion by the Oslo Accords in 1993 to end the conflict as well as its eventual failure and resuscitation once again in the Camp David Summit in 2000.

 

Week Nine:
In our last lesson, we will be looking at the developments in the Middle East from 1967 onwards to the present. First, we will discuss the victory of the narrow state interest over the wishes of the Arab collective. We will then have an in-depth look into Saddam Hussein&#39;s Iraq, Assad&#39;s Syria and the process of national identity formation in Jordan and among the Palestinians. Our next discussion will be on the Islamic revival in the Middle East, which stemmed from the disappointment with secular nationalism. We will learn about the complaints of the Islamists and their arguments against the marginalization of religion in politics and society. We will trace the development of this Islamic revival in Egypt, Syria and Iraq and its impact on the series of popular uprisings known as the Arab Spring, which have engulfed the region since late 2010. What had transpired in the meantime in the non-Arab states of Turkey and Iran will be our last discussion.

ModPo is a fast-paced introduction to modern and contemporary U.S. poetry, with an emphasis on experimental verse, from Dickinson and Whitman to the present. Participants (who need no prior experience with poetry) will learn how to read poems that are supposedly &quot;difficult.&quot;</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
In this fast-paced course we will read and encounter and discuss a great range of modern and contemporary U.S. poets working in the &quot;experimental mode,&quot; starting with the 19th-century proto-modernists Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman and ending with 21st-century conceptual poetics. Aside from providing a perhaps handy or helpful survey and chronology of 20th- and 21st-century poetry, this course offers a way of understanding general cultural transitions from modernism to postmodernism. Some people may wish to enroll as much to gain an understanding of the modernism/postmodernism problem through a study of poetry as to gain access to the work of these many poets. Participants do not need to have any prior knowledge of poetry or poetics. The instructor, Al Filreis, rarely lectures, and frequently calls for &quot;the end of the lecture as we know it&quot;; instead, the video-recorded lessons will consist of collaborative close readings led by Filreis, seminar-style -- offering models or samples of readers&#39; interpretations of these knotty but powerful poems, aided by the poetry-minded denizens of the Kelly Writers House on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania.
FAQ
Are there any pre-requisites?
No -- none at all. You do not need to know anything about poetry (modern or otherwise) to thrive in this course. You need only be willing to spend some extra time with a poem that seems difficult at first.

Are there going to be days and times when I need to &quot;attend&quot; a live session? Do I need to make myself available to participate at certain times of each week?
No. Each week you will be reading some poems, viewing approximately 2 hours of videos (discussions of poems), and participating in the discussion forum whenever you have the time - at whatever time of day you prefer. You will have the option of participating in regularly scheduled live webcast sessions, at certain times; these are a great deal of fun but, again, they are optional - and we will immediately provide recordings of the webcasts.

Do I need to purchase any textbooks for the course?
No.

Do you recommend that I read some poetry in order to prepare for the course?
Not necessary, but a good idea. Read a few poems by Emily Dickinson and perhaps some of Walt Whitman&#39;s &quot;Song of Myself.&quot; The works of those two poets are widely available on the web; we will be discussing them in the first week of the course. If you are shopping for books of poetry, we recommend buying a volume of the poems of William Carlos Williams.

You say the course is &quot;fast paced.&quot; Will it move too fast for me?
ModPo is &quot;fast paced&quot; because we will not spend long on any one poet. This is a &quot;survey&quot; course -- covering many poets with the objective of conveying a sense of poetic movements and trends. We will study only a few poets in any depth (Dickinson, Williams, Gertrude Stein, John Ashbery) but otherwise during each week we will typically talk about poems by three or four or even five different poets.

How do the videos fit into the course? What about discussion forums?
Each filmed/recorded discussion will consist of a close reading of a single poem. To prepare, you will merely need to read (and perhaps re-read) that poem. The process should be straightforward: read the poem, watch the video, then participate in discussion forums, take a short quiz (if assigned) or write a short essay (if assigned). The discussion forums are very important in ModPo -- a place to get others&#39; responses to the poems and to ask questions about concepts you don&#39;t understand. You should plan to participate in the discussion forums.

Will there be quizzes as there are in other online courses? Does that make sense in a humanities course?
There will be quizzes, yes, but the goal of these is not to ascertain correctness or incorrectness -- but to give you a sense of what ideas you are or are not comprehending from the video discussions, and to underscore which concepts are especially important.

Will a Statement of Accomplishment or &quot;certificate&quot; be awarded at the end of ModPo?
Yes. But please note that thousands have enjoyed ModPo - and being part of the ModPo community - without taking the certificate. The requirements for receiving a certificate of completion will soon be finalized and announced, but are likely to include: submit four essays; write and submit at least 16 peer reviews of others&#39; essays; take all quizzes (2 per week) and receive scores of higher than 0.0 on all of them; participate at least once weekly in the poem-specific discussion forums. ModPo is an ungraded, non-credit course; in creating and offering this learning experience, we assume that participants are not receiving course credit.

This course examines how the idea of &quot;the modern&quot; develops at the end of the 18th century in European philosophy and literature, and how being modern (or progressive, or hip) became one of the crucial criteria for understanding and evaluating cultural change. Are we still in modernity, or have we moved beyond the modern to the postmodern?</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
In this course we shall examine how the idea of &quot;the modern&quot; develops at the end of the 18th century in European intellectual history, and how being modern (or progressive, or hip) became one of the crucial criteria for understanding and evaluating cultural change during the last two hundred years in the West. We shall be concerned with the relations between culture and historical change, and our materials shall be drawn from a variety of areas: philosophy, the novel, and critical theory. Finally, we shall try to determine what it means to be modern today, and whether it makes sense to go beyond the modern to the postmodern.
The Modern and the Postmodern traces the intertwining of the idea of modernity with the idea of art or culture from the late 18th century until the present. Beginning with the Enlightenment, Western cultures have invested heavily in the notion that the world can be made more of a home for human beings through the development of culture (and technology). Throughout this period there has also developed a strong, sophisticated counter-movement that sees the Enlightenment effort as a disaster – destructive of both art and of the world.

The Western idea of modernity is linked to but not the same as the idea of modernism. We will examine both in this class and then consider postmodernism in relation both to the philosophical idea of modernity and to the aesthetic considerations of modernism.

This course covers a lot of ground, historically, conceptually and aesthetically. There is much to read, and very different kinds of reading: from philosophy to novels, from theory to poetry. Not all students will like all the reading, but if you digest it all, you should have a clearer sense of the cultural history of our present. 

Students should develop a historical, literary and philosophical understanding of some of the key themes of modernity and modernism in the West. They should learn to read classic and contemporary texts for their arguments, beauty and pertinence. They should see why these texts are “good to think with,” and, it is hoped, they will develop an appetite for further study in the areas covered by the course.

	<field name="course_intro">The Modern World: Global History since 1760
This is a survey of modern history from a global perspective. It begins with the revolutions of the late 1700s, tracks the transformation of the world during the 1800s, and analyzes the cataclysms of last century, concluding with the new phase of world history we are experiencing today.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This is a survey course in modern world history for students, beginning or advanced, who wish to better understand how the world got to be the way it is today. In order to understand modern history, a global perspective is essential. This is true whether you are interested in economics, warfare, philosophy, politics, or even pop culture. This course can therefore be essential for students in many fields, a base equipping them with tools for lifelong learning. 



In its current form, this course on Coursera is not offered for college credit. But it is a vital part of the for credit course on this topic being offered at the University of Virginia in the spring semester of 2014. Both the Coursera and the UVA students use the same online material as a common foundation for their different learning experiences.  This is the material to survey &#39;what happened&#39; and the big questions about how to explain so many changes – some of those questions that start with:  &quot;Why?&quot;  (The students in the UVA course then supplement this online material with a lot of additional reading; research projects on the histories of particular communities around the world; in-person tutorials and discussions, both with the professor and with the graduate teaching assistants; and examinations.)



It is tempting to think that if we can just understand the big patterns, we don&#39;t have to get too caught up in the details. In this course, though, we care about chronology. We care about individuals. Without some careful attention to sequences of cause and effect, without tracing how big changes come from the choices made by particular people, history can turn into just a series of descriptions, a somewhat tiresome recitation of one thing after another. So beyond just offering a set of remarkable stories, this course offers you training in how to analyze a situation and how to think about problems of explaining change.

Course Syllabus
In the outline that follows, the chronological periods being covered are approximate:

Week One: From the Traditional to the Modern: Commercial and Military Revolutions (1760-1800)

Week Two: Democratic Revolutions of the Atlantic World (1760-1800)

Week Three: Revolutionary Wars (1800-1830)

Week Four: The World Transformed (1830-1870)

Week Five: The Rise of National Industrial States (1830-1871)

Week Six: The Rise of National Industrial Empires (1871-1900)

Week Seven: The Great Acceleration (1890-1910)

Week Eight: Crackup (1905-1917)

Week Nine: New Orders Emerge (1917-1930)

Week Ten: The Crisis of the World (1930-1940)

Week Eleven: Total War and Aftermath (1940-1950)

Week Twelve: The Return of Wartime (1950-1968)

Week Thirteen: Decay and Renaissance (1969-1991)

Week Fourteen: The Next Phase (1991-2013)  

Recommended Background
No background is required. All that is needed is an interest in historical exploration.
Suggested Readings
Coursera students are not required to purchase any book. I suggest, however, that you purchase the following textbook:  Peter von Sivers, Charles Desnoyers, &amp; George Stow, Patterns of World History: Since 1750 (New York: Oxford University Press, 2012). 

This book is available in print and as an e-book. Notice that the &quot;Since 1750&quot; volume is what is being recommended -- the textbook has versions covering earlier periods, so be sure to purchase the one for the modern era. And if you prefer not to buy the book, or it is not available for sale in your country (because of copyright or other problems), you can still take and successfully complete this course.

Other relevant readings (articles, book excerpts, etc.) may be posted for download throughout the course, depending on their availability. 

Course Format
Each week has two to three hours of video presentations organized around a theme and covering a defined period of history. There are five to nine of these relatively short presentations a week, each devoted to a particular topic within that week&#39;s theme. Video presentations are accompanied by in-video quiz questions and optional reading assignments to reinforce your grasp on the factual material being covered and some of the interpretive problems. There are also twenty-question weekly quizzes, based only on each week&#39;s video presentations; these weekly quizzes are the only graded component of the course.

Preview Lectures</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This course is about molecular evolution - the evolution of DNA, RNA, and protein molecules. The focus is on computational methods for inferring phylogenetic trees from sequence data, and the course will give an introduction to the fundamental theory and algorithms, while also giving the student hands-on experience with some widely used software tools. Since evolutionary theory is the conceptual foundation of biology (in the words of Theodosius Dobzhansky: &quot;Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution&quot;), what you learn on this course will be relevant for any project you will ever do inside the life sciences. A phylogenetic tree will almost always help you think more clearly about your biological problem. 

A special emphasis is put on methods that employ explicit models of the evolutionary process (maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches), and we will explore the role of statistical modeling in molecular evolution, and in science more generally. A mathematical (statistical) model of a biological system can be considered to be a stringently phrased hypothesis about that system, and this way of thinking about models will often be helpful. In addition to model-based methods, you will also learn about other approaches, such as those based on parsimony and genetic distance (e.g., neighbor joining). 

Often, the evolutionary tree is the result we are interested in - knowing how a set of sequences (or organisms) are related can provide us with important information about the biological problem we are  investigating. For instance, knowing which organisms are most closely related to a newly identified, uncharacterized, pathogenic bacterium will allow you to infer many aspects of its lifestyle, thereby giving you important clues about how to fight it. In other cases, however, inferring the structure of the tree is not the goal: for instance, our main focus may instead be the detection of positions in a protein undergoing positive selection (indicating adaptation) or negative selection (indicating conserved functional importance). However, even in these cases, the underlying phylogenetic tree will be an important part of our hypothesis about (model of) how the proteins have been evolving, and will help in getting the correct answer. 

Although the study of molecular evolution does require a certain level of mathematical understanding, this course has been designed to be accessible also for students with limited computational background (e.g., students of biology).

Topics covered:

Brief introduction to evolutionary theory and population genetics.
Mechanisms of molecular evolution.
Models of substitution.
Reconstruction of phylogenetic trees using parsimony, distance based methods, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian techniques.
Advanced models of nucleotide substitution (gamma-distributed mutation rates, codon models and analysis of selective pressure).
Statistical analysis of biological hypotheses (likelihood ratio tests, Akaike Information Criterion, Bayesian statistics).

Course Syllabus
Week 1:   Introduction to evolutionary theory and population genetics: models of growth, selection and mutation
Week 2:   Neutral mutations and genetic drift. Tree reconstruction by parsimony
Week 3:   Consensus trees. Distance matrix methods
Week 4:   Models of sequence evolution. Likelihood methods
Week 5:   Bayesian inference of phylogeny
Week 6:   Testing hypotheses in a phylogenetic context

Recommended Background
Basic molecular biology (important)
Basic bioinformatics (semi important - student should understand the concept of a biological sequence, know what an alignment is and how to construct it, and how to search sequence databases)
Basic mathematics (less important, but student should not be afraid of math - the course has been designed to be accessible also for biology students)
Knowledge of UNIX is not required but will be helpful (exercise manuals will introduce the subject gradually, and we will provide links to self-help resources)
Suggested Readings
Inferring Phylogenies by Joseph Felsenstein, Sinauer Associates, Inc
Course Format
The course will consist of lectures, quizzes, weekly quizzes and computer exercises. The quizzes are used both to test student knowledge and as a pedagogical tool for putting focus on key aspects of the theory. The student will acquire practical experience in the use of a range of computational methods and programs by analyzing sequences from the scientific literature.

Introduction to a “money view” of economic activity for modern times, building on the intellectual traditions of British central banking and American institutionalism. Part One explores the economics of payment systems and money markets. Part Two explores connections with foreign exchange and capital markets.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
The last three or four decades have seen a remarkable evolution in the institutions that comprise the modern monetary system. The financial crisis of 2007-2009 is a wakeup call that we need a similar evolution in the analytical apparatus and theories that we use to understand that system. Produced and sponsored by the Institute for New Economic Thinking, this course is an attempt to begin the process of new economic thinking by reviving and updating some forgotten traditions in monetary thought that have become newly relevant.

Three features of the new system are central.

Most important, the intertwining of previously separate capital markets and money markets has produced a system with new dynamics as well as new vulnerabilities. The financial crisis revealed those vulnerabilities for all to see. The result was two years of desperate innovation by central banking authorities as they tried first this, and then that, in an effort to stem the collapse.  

Second, the global character of the crisis has revealed the global character of the system, which is something new in postwar history but not at all new from a longer time perspective.  Central bank cooperation was key to stemming the collapse, and the details of that cooperation hint at the outlines of an emerging new international monetary order. 

Third, absolutely central to the crisis was the operation of key derivative contracts, most importantly credit default swaps and foreign exchange swaps. Modern money cannot be understood separately from modern finance, nor can modern monetary theory be constructed separately from modern financial theory. That&#39;s the reason this course places dealers, in both capital markets and money markets, at the very center of the picture, as profit-seeking suppliers of market liquidity to the new system of market-based credit.

Recommended Background
The Barnard version of this course requires Intermediate Microeconomics and Intermediate Macroeconomics as prerequisites for economics majors, but non-economics majors (such as engineers and historians) without those prerequisites have taken the course and done fine. The important thing is some familiarity with economic reasoning and concepts and perhaps some familiarity with the subject matter (such as through job experience or an internship).  
Suggested Readings
The lectures are meant to be complete in themselves, and there is no assigned textbook for the course. Weekly readings by a variety of different authors will be posted to introduce students to the range of discourse on money. Students may wish to purchase my book The New Lombard Street, How the Fed Became the Dealer of Last Resort (Princeton 2011), which is also meant to be complete in itself, as a backstop for the videos.
Course Format
The class will consist of lecture videos, shot live in the classroom but then edited down into digestible segments, with integrated quiz questions and animated slide videos added. There will also be weekly quizzes and a final exam.
FAQ
What is the coolest thing I&#39;ll learn if I take this class? You will learn to read, understand, and evaluate professional discourse about the current operation of money markets at the level of the Financial Times.</field>

Most important, the intertwining of previously separate capital markets and money markets has produced a system with new dynamics as well as new vulnerabilities. The financial crisis revealed those vulnerabilities for all to see. The result was two years of desperate innovation by central banking authorities as they tried first this, and then that, in an effort to stem the collapse.  

Second, the global character of the crisis has revealed the global character of the system, which is something new in postwar history but not at all new from a longer time perspective.  Central bank cooperation was key to stemming the collapse, and the details of that cooperation hint at the outlines of an emerging new international monetary order. 

Third, absolutely central to the crisis was the operation of key derivative contracts, most importantly credit default swaps and foreign exchange swaps. Modern money cannot be understood separately from modern finance, nor can modern monetary theory be constructed separately from modern financial theory. That&#39;s the reason this course places dealers, in both capital markets and money markets, at the very center of the picture, as profit-seeking suppliers of market liquidity to the new system of market-based credit.

Recommended Background
The Barnard version of this course requires Intermediate Microeconomics and Intermediate Macroeconomics as prerequisites for economics majors, but non-economics majors (such as engineers and historians) without those prerequisites have taken the course and done fine. The important thing is some familiarity with economic reasoning and concepts and perhaps some familiarity with the subject matter (such as through job experience or an internship).

The best background for Part Two is Part One, but the first week of Part Two is a high-level review of Part One in case you missed it.  
Suggested Readings
The lectures are meant to be complete in themselves, and there is no assigned textbook for the course. Weekly readings by a variety of different authors will be posted to introduce students to the range of discourse on money. Students may wish to purchase my book The New Lombard Street, How the Fed Became the Dealer of Last Resort (Princeton 2011), which is also meant to be complete in itself, as a backstop for the videos.  
Course Format
The class will consist of lecture videos, shot live in the classroom but then edited down into digestible segments, with integrated quiz questions and animated slide videos added. There will also be weekly quizzes and a final exam.
FAQ
What is the coolest thing I&#39;ll learn if I take this class?  You will learn what is shadow banking, how it arose as a consequence of financial globalization, why it broke and what needs to be done to fix it.</field>

How can we explain kindness and cruelty? Where does our sense of right and wrong come from? Why do people so often disagree about moral issues? This course explores the psychological foundations of our moral lives.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
How is it that we are capable of transcendent kindness—and unspeakable cruelty? How do we make sense of people’s strongly-held opinions about abortion, gay marriage, affirmative action, and torture? How do evolution, culture, and religion conspire to shape our moral natures?

These are among the most important—and most exciting—questions around, and they are the focus of this course. We will explore the modern science of moral belief and moral action, drawing upon disciplines such as cognitive science, neuroscience, economics, and philosophy. We will look at research from the lab, from the community, and from the battlefield; we will discuss babies, monkeys, and psychopaths; we will debate claims about moral differences between men and women, liberals and conservatives, Christians and Muslims. This course will cover prejudice and bigotry, sexuality and purity; punishment, revenge, and forgiveness; and much much more. 

As a preview, we have uploaded the introductory lecture to YouTube, which you can view here: http://youtu.be/1jUd72Dmd_A

Course Syllabus

Week 1: The Big Questions
What is morality, anyway? What are the big debates in the field of moral psychology?
Week 2: Compassion 
Where does concern for others come from? How is it related to empathy—and is more empathy necessarily a good thing? And what can we learn from the study of those who seemingly lack normal moral feelings, such as violent psychopaths?

Week 3: Origins of Morality 
Here, we ask about which aspects of morality are universal. We discuss evolution, cross-cultural research, and the fascinating new science of the moral life of babies.

Week 4: Differences 
How does culture influence our moral thought and moral action? What role does religion play? Why are some of us conservative and others liberal, and how do political differences influence our sense of right and wrong?

Week 5: Family, friends, and strangers 
Our moral feelings are usually most powerful towards our kin (such as our parents and our children) and our friends and allies. We will discuss these special bonds, and then turn to the morality of racial and ethnic bias. Then we use the tools of behavioral economics to explore the controversial question of whether we are ever truly altruistic to strangers.

Week 6: The Big Answers  
We’ll discuss some clever studies that show how our moral behavior is powerfully influenced—often at the unconscious level—by the situations that we find ourselves in. Such findings raise some hard problems about determinism, free will, and moral responsibility. Most of all, if our actions are determined by our brains, our genes, and our situations, in what sense can we be said to be moral agents? The course will end by trying to address this question. 

Suggested Readings
My new book on morality—Just Babies: The Origins of Good and Evil—is now available. This is highly recommended for the course. (Purchase book from Amazon | Barnes &amp; Noble). Other readings, as well as links to certain video lectures and TED talks, will be available for free on the course website. 

FAQ
1. Do I need any special background to take this course? 
No. If you can read a popular science book, or an article in a magazine such as The Atlantic or The New Yorker, you should be able to follow the lectures and readings. 

2. Is this course for the faint of heart? 
It is not. We will examine, from an objective and scientific perspective, some beliefs that many of us hold sacred. We will discuss religion, politics, and sex—sometimes all at the same time. If this idea is disturbing, this might not be the course for you.  

3. Is this a psychology course? 
Sort of. I am a psychologist and the questions that we’ll be dealing with, concerning how people behave and how people think, are fundamentally psychological questions. And so we’ll be talking a lot about research and theory from psychology. At the same time, though, other disciplines have a lot of say about our moral lives, and so we’ll also be discussing work by philosophers, economics, neuroscientists and other scholars.  

4. I don’t want to wait until 2014. Is there anything I can do to start right away? 
Yes! One thing you can do is get hold of the optional book for this course, Just Babies: The Origins of Good and Evil.  (Purchase book from Amazon |  Barnes &amp; Noble). Another thing you can do is get ahead of the course by getting started with some readings and videos, I recommend the following (all of these will be discussed in the course).  
“The Moral Life of Babies”, by Paul Bloom, in the New York Times Magazine
“The Moral Instinct”, by Steven Pinker, in the New York Times Magazine
“The Moral Roots of Liberals and Conservatives”, by Jonathan Haidt, TED talk
“Science Can Answer Moral Questions”, by Sam Harris, TED talk
5. Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.

Students can also elect to enroll in the Signature Track to earn a Verified Certificate. 

6. I have some questions about the course and/or ideas for topics I’d like you to cover. Can I contact you? 
Due to the anticipated size of the class, I can’t promise to answer emails. But I do read all them.  I’ll take any suggestions seriously, and if there are questions that come up several times, I’ll add them to the FAQ page. You can email me at moralities@yale.edu.</field>

	<field name="course_intro">MOS Transistors
Learn how MOS transistors work, and how to model them. The understanding provided in this course is essential not only for device modelers, but also for designers of high-performance circuits.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
The MOS transistor (MOSFET) is the workhorse of the microelectronic revolution. It is estimated that there are currently over 1 billion transistors per human being in the world. Part of the MOS transistor&#39;s success lies in its very small size (you can fit 1,000 of them within the width of a human hair!), part lies on some amazing things this device can do. However, the descriptions of MOS transistors in basic electronics courses cannot begin to do justice to this device. If you want to really know how the MOSFET operates, and how to model it, you need to study it carefully and systematically. This course will help you do just that. 

The course starts with a review of basic physical principles, and expands into a detailed treatment of MOS transistor phenomena, in a logical and systematic fashion, enhanced by intuitive discussions. We discuss a hierarchy of models - from the simple to the sophisticated - clearly identifying the connections between them, and encompassing many aspects of modeling, including dc, large-signal transient operation, quasi-static operation, non-quasi-static operation, small-signal operation, noise, and structural effects. We discuss the concepts on which the most popular CAD (computer-aided design) MOS transistor models are based.

Course Syllabus
·      Intuitive overview of the MOS Transistor.

·      Background review (semiconductors and pn junctions).

·      The 2-terminal MOS structure.

·      The 3-terminal MOS structure.

·      Long-channel MOS transistor all-region modeling.

·      Strong inversion models.

·      Weak inversion models.

·      Source reference models vs. body reference models.

·      Effective mobility.

·      Short channel effects. Velocity saturation, channel length modulation,
       two-dimensional charge sharing. Narrow channel effects.

·      DIBL. Punchthrough. Hot carrier effects. Ballistic operation.

·      Poly depletion. QM effects; DC gate current.

·      Scaling.

·      Considerations for CAD modeling.

·      Large-signal dynamic operation. 

·      Charge modeling. 

·      Quasi-static and non-quasi-static modeling.

·      Small-signal modeling.

·      Noise.

·      RF small-signal modeling.

·      Substrate nonuniformity and structural effects.

Recommended Background
This course assumes a background in basic calculus and in basic circuits and electronics. The course will include a quick refresher of basic semiconductor concepts (electrons and holes, intrinsic and extrinsic semiconductors, drift and diffusion, etc.).
Suggested Readings
Although the lectures are designed to be self-contained, it is highly recommended that students read, after each weekly set of lectures, the corresponding sections in the book by Yannis Tsividis and Colin McAndrew, Operation and Modeling of the MOS Transistor, 3rd edition, Oxford University Press, 2011, ISBN 9780195170153, or its international edition version, The MOS Transistor, by the same authors. This book was written specifically for such a course. 

NOTE: Oxford University Press is offering for a limited time a low-cost MOOC version of the book to participants in this course.  You can search for the book on the Oxford University Press Higher Education website (http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/he/) using the ISBN number 9780199325993. 
Course Format
The class will consist of lecture videos, which are broken into small chunks, usually between five and twelve minutes each, accompanied by stand-alone quizzes and homework problems. There will be a midterm exam and a final exam.
FAQ
Will I benefit from this course if I am an integrated circuit designer?
If you are designing analog or high-performance digital and mixed-signal circuits, the answer is certainly yes. The modern MOSFET is a device with complex and idiosyncratic behavior; you cannot treat it as a black box and hope to develop efficient, high-performance circuits with it. It is no longer sufficient to treat it as a textbook &quot;square-law device&quot;; modern devices are not square-law. It is no longer sufficient to think that the device is off if its gate voltage is below the threshold; your watch contains many transistors operating with their gate voltage below the threshold, and they are certainly not off! To design high-caliber circuits, you need a high-caliber understanding of your transistors.

What computing resources are required for this course?
All you need is a math package, such as Matlab, MathCad, Mathematica, or any other package that can help you quickly evaluate algebraic expressions and make plots. Such packages often have inexpensive student versions available. There is also math freeware, such as GNU Octave, available on the Web. 

How easy is it to get by in this course without reading the textbook?
Some students could get by without it, depending on their background and their learning style; but reading the textbook will really help. The textbook provides detailed explanations for everything we cover in the lectures, including parts  which, due to lack of time, are just mentioned and taken for granted. At Columbia, students taking a similar course spend about half of their time reading the textbook, and half doing the homework.

Do I need a background in semiconductor devices? 
You do not need a background beyond what is provided in many basic electronics courses, concerning electrons and holes, intrinsic and extrinsic semiconductors, drift and diffusion, etc. However, even these concepts will be reviewed at the beginning of the course. If you have not seen such material before, this review, together with reading the first chapter of the textbook, should be enough to allow you to follow the rest of the course.</field>

This course will focus on eight important works from the Western classical-music repertoire that represent different eras and genres throughout history. We&#39;ll observe performances of this music recorded at Curtis, and our interactive discussions will explore each work’s historical context, musical significance, and compositional design.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
A survey of music history begins with those works of music that convey the artistic trends, innovations, and compositional techniques representative of their time. Rather than offer a discussion of Western music focusing on a succession of composers, this course will look at key works throughout history: from early music composed more than one thousand years ago to music of our time. Through videos covering historical context and recorded performances, students will learn how Western music has developed throughout the ages into the rich and diverse repertoire that we have today.

What makes this music truly special and important? Distinguished members of the Curtis faculty will provide their unique insights. Performances by Curtis students, alumni, and faculty will enhance the learning experience by demonstrating the form and design of the material in a creative and vital way. 

By the end of the course, students should be able:

to understand a general survey of the development of Western classical music through the ages
to better understand each piece covered and to develop the skills to do more research about these and other pieces
Course Syllabus
The first week offers an historical overview as a starting point. The remaining six weeks examine specific repertoire, with recordings of performances by Curtis students and alumni provided online. Lecture videos explore the era, the composer, and the piece, from both music history and music theory perspectives.

Part of the &quot;Modern Musician&quot; Specialization »
Learn the basic concepts and approaches needed to understand, create, and perform contemporary music.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
If you have a passion for music and are curious about how it works, or if you are a musician who learned to play by ear without formal study, this course will provide you with an engaging introduction to key concepts and approaches needed to understand, create, and perform contemporary music. Taught by Berklee College of Music professor George W. Russell, Jr., the course includes six lessons that delve into harmony and ear training—two areas of intensive focus for every entering Berklee student. 

The course will teach you the major scale and minor pentatonic scale, and how they are constructed. You will learn what intervals are, how to sing them, and how to find them in music. The course explores tonal centers and how to find the key a song is in, in addition to common time signatures such as 4/4 and 3/4. You will learn how to build chords—major and minor triads, and major and dominant seventh chords—and how to build a common chord progression—the I IV V. You will also learn how to recognize the blues and AABA song forms, and write a basic chord sheet to express your song ideas. 

In addition to the video lectures, each lesson features Berklee student performances and interviews. The students share their musical journey and offer advice for those wanting to study music. The course culminates with an assignment that asks you to compose and perform a riff blues tune using the minor pentatonic scale. Above all, the course is designed to share the joy of creating music and sharing it with others.

Course Syllabus
Lesson 1: Major Scale 
Defining Harmony, Ear Training, and Intervals; Constructing and Singing the Major Scale; Major 2nd and Major 3rd Intervals; Finding the Tonal Center 
Lesson 2: Major and Minor Triads

Recommended Background
The ability to play an instrument is helpful but not required. You should have a passion for music and a strong interest in developing your understanding of music and ability to create it.
Suggested Readings
None.
Course Format
The course consists of video demonstrations, with integrated quizzes that allow you to reinforce your knowledge of the material before moving on. You will also have peer-reviewed assignments that ask you to put the material you have learned into practice. 
FAQ

Do I need to have prior musical ability?
No. Experience playing an instrument is helpful but not necessary. 
What do I need to take the class?
You should have access to a keyboard or piano. You will be asked to practice what you are learning on the keyboard for 15 minutes each day. If you do not have access to a keyboard, you can use one of the many keyboards available online (make sure it can play chords, or more than one note at a time), though an actual keyboard or piano is preferred in order for you to get the most out of the course. 

A digital camera to take pictures of handwritten assignments for review and grading by your peers. 
What are the assignments like?
During the course, you will be asked to practice the major and minor pentatonic scale, triads, and seventh chords on your keyboard each day (no special fingerings are needed). The assignments will ask you to do such things as writing out a scale, finding songs that use a particular key or chord progression, and creating a chord sheet with a particular song form. The final assignment will ask you to compose a riff blues tune, and if you&#39;re able, perform the song for your classmates. You will also complete quizzes periodically throughout the course.</field>

Part of the &quot;Modern Musician&quot; Specialization »
Learn about the music production process—including recording, editing, and mixing—and the tools available to you to create contemporary music on your computer.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
With the recent introduction of high-quality-low-cost software and hardware, the tools of music production are now available to the masses. Albums are made in bedrooms as well as studios. On the surface this is liberating. Anyone can make an album for the low cost of a couple pieces of gear and a software package. But, if you dig deeper, you will find that it is not so easy. Producing music requires knowledge, dedication, and creativity.
    
Knowledge is where this course comes in. No matter what kind of music you are making, there is a large set of tools that you will need to use.  Each lesson of this course will demonstrate a different set of music production tools, loosely following along the music production process of recording, editing, and mixing. 

We will start with some background on the nature of sound and how we perceive it. We will then examine the components necessary to record audio into a computer, so that you understand the devices that sound must travel through in a music production process. 
    
Once recorded, sound must be organized along a timeline, a process known as editing. It allows us to give the impression of perfect performances and create many of the sounds we hear in contemporary music. The contemporary editing tool is the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW),  a piece of software that stores and organizes all the assets of a musical project. We will focus on the editing tools that are essential in contemporary music production and that all DAWs provide. 

After editing, sounds must be combined or mixed together, so we look to the mixing board—a very creative place if you know how to use it. We will explore the basic functionality of both hardware and software mixing boards, including volume, pan, mute, solo, busses, inserts, sends, and submixes. The mixing process, however, includes more tools than the mixing board provides on its own. Sound must also be processed, modified from its recorded state to fit the context of the music. We will look at compression, equalization, and delay, and examine the many audio effects that are offshoots of these devices and how they are used in a musical context.
    
We will then explore the synthesizer, a major tool within the production of contemporary music. Yes, great music can and will be created without the synthesizer, but learning how a synthesizer works will give you a language to describe sound. Music is a collaborative art form, so there is nothing more powerful than effective communication. 
    
In the end, the music production process relies on your creativity. Creativity is a product of the mind and will stay there, unexpressed, until the right tools are used in the right way to share it with the world. If you have an idea in your head, it will take numerous steps, each with an important tool, to reach your audience. You bring the dedication and creativity, and this course will bring you the knowledge to make that happen.

Explores the factors — musical and cultural — that led to the birth of American rock &#39;n&#39; roll music in the early 1950s.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
How did rock &#39;n&#39; roll music come to be?

Join us to explore Music&#39;s Big Bang -- how music brought to America by immigrants evolved, blended and eventually became the delectable stew that is rock &#39;n&#39; roll.
We will see and hear the ingredients in that stew, such as blues, jazz and gospel, and explore rock &#39;n&#39; roll&#39;s first half decade, roughly 1955 to 1960. We will consider cultural factors, too, including the advance of technology, the migration of rural Americans from the South to the cities of the North, and the threats to mainstream American values presented by teenage rebellion and the Civil Rights Movement.

Course Syllabus
Week 1 What is rock &#39;n&#39; roll? It&#39;s a whole lot more than just music. It&#39;s a business, an attitude, a cultural phenomenon, a showcase of technology and more.
Week 2 Before there was rock: Major musical genres, technological advances and players integral to the birth of rock &#39;n&#39; roll. The genres include jazz, blues, country, western, bluegrass, gospel, popular music and more.
Week 3 Mississippi Ghosts: W.C. Handy and the Delta Blues of Robert Johnson, Son House, Charley Patton and Lead Belly.
Week 4 A Tale of Three Cities: New Orleans&#39; jazz and early rock &#39;n roll, Chicago and its electric blues, and Memphis, Tenn., home of Elvis Presley and Sun Records.
Week 5 The emergence of Chuck Berry, Little Richard and Bo Diddley; the Sun Records &quot;Class of 1955&quot; and &quot;The Day the Music Died.&quot;
Week 6 The major labels finally awaken and start to rock: The search is on for the next big thing, Elvis II.
Week 7 The five styles of rock &#39;n&#39; roll as postulated by author Charlie Gillett.
Week 8 Summation and project review.

Learn to make music with digital audio workstation software, understand the theory and history behind music production tools, and write your own computer programs to make new music and sounds.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course

How can we use computers to create expressive, compelling music? And how can we write computer software to help us create and organize sounds in new ways? This course provides a hands-on introduction to the field of music technology as both a creative musical practice and an interdisciplinary technical research pursuit. Through the exploration of topics such as acoustics, psychoacoustics, digital sound, digital signal processing, audio synthesis, spectral analysis, algorithmic composition, and music information retrieval, we will explore the deep relationships between art and science, between theory and practice, and between experimental and popular electronic music.

We will learn about these topics in the context of digital audio workstation (DAW) software, the multi-track editing paradigm that has been dominant in music production since the 1980s. As we learn about the foundations behind such software, we will use this knowledge to more effectively create music with it, and we will also write a series of short software programs that extend the software’s ability to manipulate, transform, and analyze sound.

Grading Policy:
There will be a quiz at the end of each module (except module 0) for a total of 6 quizzes. Quizzes consist of multiple-choice and short-response questions and cover lecture material from the module.

There are two hands-on projects in the course, due at the end of module 3 and at the end of module 5. These projects will be graded through a peer assessment system.

The grade breakdown is as follows:

60% - quizzes
40% - projects
In order to receive a statement of accomplishment, you must get 70% or higher for the course. In order to receive a statement of accomplishment with distinction, you must get 90% or higher for the course.

Course Syllabus
Module 1: The Basics of Sound
acoustics, psychoacoustics, timbre, digital representation of sound, spectral representation of sound

Module 2: Digital Audio Workstations
DAW history and key features, music representation, recording and editing audio in a DAW, effects and automations, aesthetic context

Module 3: Working with MIDI
MIDI specification (history, structure, limitations), real and virtual MIDI devices, MIDI sequencing in the DAW

Module 4: Synthesis and Signal Processing

Learn what motivates the restive Muslim youth from Tunis to Tehran, what political positions Islamists from Mali to Chechnya are fighting for, where the seeming obsession with Islamic law comes from, where the secularists have vanished to, and whether it makes sense to speak of an Islamic state.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Since 2009 there has been a renewed wave of popular unrest sweeping throughout much of the Muslim world. Secular, but generally repressive and inefficient autocracies have come under pressure or been swept aside entirely. At the same, the various Islamic Republics have not fared much better, but been convulsed by internal unrest, economic and social decline. Throughout the Muslim lands, existing constitutional arrangements are being challenged, often very violently.

This course is a survey of the constitutional ideas and institutions that have developed since the mid 19th century throughout predominantly Muslim countries, but its focus will lie on the actors that have dominated this discourse and shaped its outcomes. We will look at the large body of classical writings on the Islamic state only in so far as it is necessary to understand the contemporary debate, but concentrate on the legal and political developments of the 20th and 21st centuries.

Three common themes will characterise the course: 

We privilege the study of the legal and social reality and seek to highlight where it is at odds with dogmatic stipulations, be they religious or constitutional. 
We seek to illustrate the practical tensions posed by limited administrative capabilities and political legitimacy that resulted from the incomplete reception of modern bureaucratic statehood. 
We seek to examine how popular dissatisfaction with the practical performance of Muslim governments has fuelled demands for greater accountability under the guise of cultural authenticity. 
Ultimately, the course aims to equip participants to better understand Muslim contemporary discourse about the res publica, better contextualise the demands for religious law in public life, and to better ascertain the theoretical and practical feasibility of postulated religious alternatives to the still-dominant secular model of governance.

Recommended Background
By choice and necessity, this course will be interdisciplinary and has no prerequisites. No knowledge of Arabic or other Oriental languages is assumed; neither is previous familiarity with the study of religion in general and Islamic beliefs in particular; nor with the legal method in general and constitutional law in particular. Rather than assuming a common frame of reference, it is expected that students’ diverse disciplinary backgrounds will complement each other.

Course Format
The course will consist of lectures in short (15-55 min) videos, each of which will be followed by an exercise in which participants can test their grasp of the new material. The exercises will combine multiple-choice with essay-type questions. 

Most lectures will be accompanied by written background material from the instructor which, hopefully, will eventually form the basis of a text-book. Participants are, therefore, welcome to give feedback in order to improve this material.

In addition to the books suggested, there will be suggested external readings which participants are strongly encouraged to conclude before each week&#39;s lectures. The readings will clearly differentiate between those of central and peripheral importance. 

In addition, we will make recommendations to open-source external audio-visual material, in particular TV documentations, to complement the lectures and give participants a better &#39;feel&#39; for the countries under consideration.

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
In the revival of mysticism today, mysticism has become more psychological while psychology is increasingly interested in mysticism. This course will provide an entry into the complex world of modern mysticism, through studying its psychological thought. We shall begin with exploring the interpretations of mystical experience offered by psychoanalysts in the twentieth century, starting with Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung and ending with contemporary thinkers such as James Hillman. However, we will see that the European mystical traditions, including Kabbalah in the Jewish world and those of the Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant worlds, developed their own elaborate systems of psychological thought. Thus, we will mostly examine mystical psychology on its own terms. We shall especially look at two terms that are very much in use also in general culture: the heart (as an emotional rather than a physical center!...) and the soul, looking at the unique mystical concepts of their nature and destiny and asking if there were influences and meetings between the different religions.

The course consists of seven lectures, each lasting 60-90 minutes. Lectures are divided into several 5-15 minute segments. Occasionally there will be in-class learning reinforcement exercises (These will not be calculated into the final grade of the course).

Each lecture will be followed by a homework assignment which will consist of several questions. The answers will be peer-graded by other students in the course; from our experience, this method is one of the best ways to ensure that students think about and &quot;internalize&quot; - not just memorize - the material they have learnt. The final grade of the course will be the average of the student&#39;s five highest grades (out of seven) on the homework assignments.

In this course there is no required reading. A full list of suggested readings will appear on the course session website, for those interested in deepening their understanding. 



FAQ
What is the coolest thing that I will learn in this course?

That actually twentieth century psychoanalysis itself may be indebted to religious and mystical ideas.

This course will focus on the myths of ancient Greece and Rome, as a way of exploring the nature of myth and the function it plays for individuals, societies, and nations.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Myths are traditional stories that have endured over a long time. Some of them have to do with events of great importance, such as the founding of a nation. Others tell the stories of great heroes and heroines and their exploits and courage in the face of adversity. Still others are simple tales about otherwise unremarkable people who get into trouble or do some great deed. What are we to make of all these tales, and why do people seem to like to hear them? This course will focus on the myths of ancient Greece and Rome, as a way of exploring the nature of myth and the function it plays for individuals, societies, and nations. We will also pay some attention to the way the Greeks and Romans themselves understood their own myths. Are myths subtle codes that contain some universal truth? Are they a window on the deep recesses of a particular culture? Are they a set of blinders that all of us wear, though we do not realize it? Or are they just entertaining stories that people like to tell over and over? This course will investigate these questions through a variety of topics, including the creation of the universe, the relationship between gods and mortals, human nature, religion, the family, sex, love, madness, and death.

Course Format
This course will have three types of graded activities that will be included in your overall course grade. These include:

Weekly Quizzes: You will be asked to answer ten weekly quizzes that account for 20% of the course total grade (2 points for each quiz). Each quiz includes 7 to 13 multiple choice questions that examines your understanding of the learning materials. You may take each quiz up to three times, and you will receive credit for the highest of the three scores. The regular Due date for taking a weekly quiz will be 12:00 PM (Pacific Time) on the Monday following that week’s video assignments. For example, Due date for the Week 1 quiz will be the Monday of Week 2. You may take the quiz for one week following this Due date (though still only three times total), but there will be a 10% penalty applied. The purpose of the penalty is to encourage you not to fall too far behind in the assignments.

Each Quiz includes three important dates: Opening time, Due date (for full credit), and Hard deadline (10% penalty). The exact dates are posted in the &#39;Schedule&#39; section. It is important to keep track of these dates.

Open-ended Questions: You will be asked to answer three open-ended questions that account for 20% of the course total grade . The questions encourage creative thinking, and their answers are based on the knowledge you gained in the course, as well as, on your own imagination and experience. The questions will be presented in Weeks 1, 4, and 7. Providing thorough answers to the open-ended questions will help you generate innovative ideas for your final project. Your will write your answers in a textbox, limited to 500. You can also write your answers on a document and attach it. You are welcome to explain your ideas via drawings, photos, and/or a short video of up to 1.5 minute (as a link). The deadline for submitting your answers will be 12:00 PM (Pacific Time) on the Friday, two weeks after the question was first opened. For example, the Week 1 open-ended question will be due on Friday of Week 3. The exact dates for submission will be announced during the course; late submissions will not be counted.

Since this is a peer graded task, your answers will be graded by peers, according to a grading rubric. After submitting your own answer, you will be asked to read and grad three answers of your peers.

The grading task includes two stages: a. ranking each evaluation category according to the grading rubric, b. providing written comments in the Overall Evaluation textbox. The written comments should include at least 1 paragraph of information for each evaluation category. They should be critical as well as positive. If you give low ratings, you need to explain to your peer how s/he can improve their ideas. It is always good practice to refer to the lecture contents when you are making critical comments.

Each open-ended question task includes three important dates: Opening time, Submission deadline, and Evaluation deadline. The exact dates are posted in the &#39;Schedule&#39; section. It is important to keep track of these dates.

Grades for the open-ended questions task will be assigned to you only after you review the work of your peers and submit your comments.s.

Final project: At the end of the course you will be asked to complete a final project. The final project will be conducted in groups of 3-to4 students. It will consist of a written report that focuses on the utilization of nanotechnology and nanosensors to imitate a specific sense that relates to human senses: vision, hearing, taste, smell, or touch. Other non-specific senses such as balance and pains can be included as well.

The final project should include, but not confined to: (a) multidisciplinary presentation and discussion of the overall design approach; (b) fabrication; (c) characterization; and (d) application of the targeted artificial sense. The report shall NOT exceed 10 pages, written in 11-12 font size, 1.5 line spacing, and 2.5 cm margins from each side of the document. The final project will be graded by your peers, according to a grading rubric, accounting for 60% of your overall course grade.</field>

Nanotechnology is an emerging area that engages almost every technical discipline – from chemistry to computer science – in the study and application of extremely tiny materials.  This short course allows any technically savvy person to go one layer beyond the surface of this broad topic to see the real substance behind the very small.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Nanotechnology is an exciting research area that spans disciplines from electrical engineering to biology.  Over the last two decades the basic science of this area has launched new technologies, the first examples of which are finding their way into commercial products.  This four week course will provide students with a bird&#39;s eye view into this fast moving area and leave students with an appreciation of the importance and foundation of super-small materials and devices.
Course Syllabus
Nanotechnology: The Basics

Week 1: Small, strange and useful! This first week we will introduce nanotechnology.  As you will learn, defining the term itself can be a challenge and the discipline has a rich and somewhat controversial history.  We will conclude the week with a tour of the different types of materials in the nanotechnology pantheon that sets up the class for the weeks to come.

Week 2: Electronics when materials are super small.  There is no doubt our lives have been changed by the small and powerful computers we now use in everything from our cell phones to our coffeemakers.  This week you will learn how nanotechnology has been a part of this revolution and what the limits are to making wires and transistors super, super small.

Week 3: How magnets change when they are made small.  Magnetism is quite mysterious and the foundation of such cool technologies as flash drives and MRI imaging.  Nanotechnology has played a crucial role in advancing all of these diverse applications and in week 3 you&#39;ll gain some insight into how that is possible.

Week 4: Shedding light on nanoscale materials and photonics.  Compared to electrons, photons are difficult things to trap and control with normal materials.  Nanomaterials offer completely new approaches to manipulating light.  Whether its through diffraction, or plasmonics, nanotechnology can provide new capabilities for solid state lasers as well as super resolution microscopes.

Recommended Background
We expect some knowledge of freshman chemistry and physics, as well as algebra.  Access to a spreadsheet program would also be of value.  However, we recognize that for some interested participants this knowledge may be rusty and will provide where possible optional review videos to go over terminology and concepts relevant to the week&#39;s material.
Suggested Readings
We will refer students to web-based materials where appropriate.  There isn&#39;t really a standard nanotechnology textbook (yet!).
Course Format
Every week students will be expected to view between 6 and 9 video lectures which are about 10 minutes each; optional refresher lectures will sometimes be added to provide background on concepts relevant for the week. Most lectures will have integrated questions to keep students engaged, and these will not count towards any grade. There will also be weekly &#39;basic&#39; quizzes and a final exam for students seeking a statement of accomplishment.  For those seeking a statement of accomplishment with distinction,  &#39;in-depth&#39; quizzes and a peer-graded project will be required in addition to the statement of accomplishment criteria.  Students will have two weeks to complete every assignment once its posted, and eight late days to apply as needed.
FAQ
What is the format of the class?
This course offers two distinct tracks. To receive a statement of accomplishment, students will complete basic quizzes and a final exam. For those who wish to receive a receive a statement of accomplishment with distinction,  they will need to complete  in-depth quizzes and a peer-graded project  in addition to the statement of accomplishment criteria. 

Regardless of track, students are given two weeks to complete every assignment after posting.  Also the late policy provides students with 8 days to apply as needed.

Are there any prerequisites?
This course requires that students (a) have ready access to and facility with a spreadsheet program like Excel; (b) have had a freshman level science class and are familiar with college level chemistry and physics.

What resources do I need for this class?
This course requires that students (a) have ready access to a spreadsheet program like Google Spreadsheet, Excel or Open Office; (b) have had a freshman level science class and have familiarity with advanced high school or college freshman chemistry and physics.

Does Rice award credentials or reports regarding my work in this course?
Rice University does not issue transcripts but does support certificates of accomplishment associated with classes as described on the course page.  Coursera will maintain limited data regarding student progress and performance in this course and, with your permission, provide authorized third parties with access to such data.</field>

An introduction to network analysis and statistical methods used in contemporary Systems Biology, Bioinformatics and Systems Pharmacology research.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
The course Network Analysis in Systems Biology provides an introduction to network analysis and statistical methods used in contemporary Systems Biology, Bioinformatics and Systems Pharmacology research. Students will learn how to construct, analyze and visualize different types of molecular networks, including gene regulatory networks connecting transcription factors to their target genes, protein-protein interaction networks, cell signaling pathways and networks, drug-target and drug-drug similarity networks and other functional association networks. Methods to process raw data from genome-wide RNA (microarrays and RNA-seq) and proteomics (IP-MS and phosphoproteomics) profiling will be presented. Processed data will be clustered, and gene-set enrichment analyses methods will be covered. The course will also discuss topics in network systems pharmacology including processing and integrating databases of drug-target interactions, drug structure, drug/adverse-events, and drug induced gene expression signatures.  

Half of the course will be devoted to describing major data resources and how these can be processed into networks, bi-partite graphs and gene set libraries for data reuse and integration. Special consideration will be made for the concept of research focus biases and experimental biases. The other half of the course will be devoted to analyses, including unsupervised clustering, data visualization techniques, network topological properties, and gene-set enrichment analyses. The course will be useful for students who encounter large datasets in their own research, typically genome-wide. The course will teach the students how to use existing software tools such as those developed by the Ma’ayan Laboratory at Mount Sinai, but also other freely available tools. In addition the course requires the students to write short scripts in Python and participate in crowdsourcing micro-  and mega-task projects. The ultimate aim of the course is to enable students to utilize the data resources and methods they learn here for analyzing their own data for their own projects.

Networked Life looks at how our world is connected -- socially, strategically and technologically -- and why it matters.

The answers to the questions above are related. They have been the subject of a fascinating intersection of disciplines, including computer science, physics, psychology, sociology, mathematics, economics and finance. Researchers from these areas all strive to quantify and explain the growing complexity and connectivity of the world around us, and they have begun to develop a rich new science along the way.

Networked Life will explore recent scientific efforts to explain social, economic and technological structures -- and the way these structures interact -- on many different scales, from the behavior of individuals or small groups to that of complex networks such as the Internet and the global economy.

This course covers computer science topics and other material that is mathematical, but all material will be presented in a way that is accessible to an educated audience with or without a strong technical background. The majority of the course is grounded in scientific and mathematical findings of the past two decades or less (often much less).

Networked Life is the flagship course of the new Networked and Social Systems Engineering program at the University of Pennsylvania.

Learn how to model social and economic networks and their impact on human behavior. How do networks form, why do they exhibit certain patterns, and how does their structure impact diffusion, learning, and other behaviors? We will bring together models and techniques from economics, sociology, math, physics, statistics and computer science to answer these questions.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Social networks pervade our social and economic lives.   They play a central role in the transmission of information about job opportunities and are critical to the trade of many goods and services. They are important in determining which products we buy, which languages we speak, how we vote, as well as whether or not we decide to become criminals, how much education we obtain, and our likelihood of succeeding professionally.   The countless ways in which network structures affect our well-being make it critical to understand how social network structures impact behavior, which network structures are likely to emerge in a society, and why we organize ourselves as we do.  This course provides an overview and synthesis of research on social and economic networks, drawing on studies by sociologists, economists, computer scientists, physicists, and mathematicians.

The course begins with some empirical background on social and economic networks, and an overview of concepts used to describe and measure networks.   Next, we will cover a set of models of how networks form, including random network models as well as strategic formation models, and some hybrids.   We will then discuss a series of models of how networks impact behavior, including contagion, diffusion, learning, and peer influences.

Recommended Background
The course has some basic prerequisites in mathematics and statistics.  For example, it will be assumed that students are comfortable with basic concepts from linear algebra (e.g., matrix multiplication), probability theory (e.g., probability distributions, expected values, Bayes&#39; rule), and statistics (e.g., hypothesis testing), and some light calculus (e.g., differentiation and integration).  Beyond those concepts, the course will be self-contained.
Suggested Readings
The course is self-contained, so that all the definitions and concepts you need to solve the problem sets and final are contained in the video lectures.  Much of the material for the course is covered in a text: Matthew O. Jackson  Social and Economic Networks, Princeton University Press (Here are Princeton University Press and Amazon  pages for the book).  The text is optional and not required for the course.  Additional background readings, including research articles and several surveys on some of the topics covered in the course can be found on my web page.
Course Format
The course will run for seven weeks, plus two for the final exam.  Each week there will be video lectures available, as well as a standalone problem set and some occasional data exercises, and there will be a final exam at the end of the course for those who wish to earn a course certificate.  

FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class (above 70 percent correct on the problem sets and final exam) will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor - and those earning above 90 percent credit on the problem sets and final will earn one with distinction.</field>

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Neural networks use learning algorithms that are inspired by our understanding of how the brain learns, but they are evaluated by how well they work for practical applications such as speech recognition, object recognition, image retrieval and the ability to recommend products that a user will like. As computers become more powerful, Neural Networks are gradually taking over from simpler Machine Learning methods. They are already at the heart of a new generation of speech recognition devices and they are beginning to outperform earlier systems for recognizing objects in images. The course will explain the new learning procedures that are responsible for these advances, including effective new proceduresr for learning multiple layers of non-linear features, and give you the skills and understanding required to apply these procedures in many other domains. 

This YouTube video gives examples of the kind of material that will be in the course, but the course will present this material at a much gentler rate and with more examples.
Recommended Background
Programming proficiency in Matlab, Octave or Python. Enough knowledge of calculus to be able to differentiate simple functions. Enough knowledge of linear algebra to understand simple equations involving vectors and matrices. Enough knowledge of probability theory to understand what a probability density is.
Course Format
The class will consist of lecture videos, which are between 5 and 15 minutes in length. These contain 1-3 integrated quiz questions per video. There will also be standalone homework that is not part of video lectures, optional programming assignments, and a (not optional) final test.
FAQ
Will I get a certificate after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a certificate signed by the instructor.

Learn how the nervous system produces behavior, how we use our brain every day, and how neuroscience can explain the common problems afflicting people today. We will study functional human neuroanatomy and neuronal communication, and then use this information to understand how we perceive the outside world, move our bodies voluntarily, stay alive, and play well with others.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
The Neurobiology of Everyday Life is a 10-week course intended for anyone interested in how the nervous system works. The course will cover three main topics: neuroanatomy, neural communication, and neural systems. We will start by exploring the overall organization of the human brain and the cellular building blocks of the brain – neurons. We will examine how the incredibly complex brain develops from a ball of embryonic cells and then look at the anatomy of nerves, the spinal cord, brainstem and forebrain. An understanding of how blood reaches the brain, the blood brain barrier, and the ventricular system will be used to understand different types of strokes. At the end of the units on neuroanatomy, students will have a strong understanding of nerve injury, spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, stroke, and brain tumors.

In the neural communication module, we will look at how electrical potentials carry information within neurons and how neurotransmitters are used to communicate information between neurons. This module will illuminate what goes wrong in epilepsy, demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis, and myasthenia gravis as well as how nerve gas, Botox, cocaine and beta-blockers act on neurons.

In the final module, all of the fundamental anatomy and physiology from the first two modules will be used to examine how 1) we perceive the outside world; 2) we act in the world either volitionally or emotionally; 3) our nervous system allows us to live; and 4) cognition works to make us the human individuals that we are. We will look at the neurobiology of everyday situations such as multitasking (walking and chewing gum) and at the ways in which the nervous system commonly fails us (e.g. motion sickness). Students will emerge from this module with an understanding of common medical problems such as Parkinson&#39;s disease, myopia, hearing loss, and fever. Throughout the course, the neurobiology of items relevant to the week’s topic (current events, YouTube videos, diseases) will be discussed in weekly forums.

3.        Strokes, traumatic injuries, and diseases

4.        Neural communication: Information transfer in the nervous system 

5.        Perception: Vision

6.        The inner ear: Hearing and balance

7.        Voluntary movement: From stumbling to Simon Says

8.        Voluntary movement: Coordination, chunking and habit

9.        Homeostasis: Thermoregulation, sleep, and eating

10.      Executive function: Memory, language, playing well with others

 

Recommended Background
Anyone interested in the brain is encouraged to sign up. No background is required. For those who may have forgotten their high school biology, short lessons for catch-up will be available as well as suggestions for further study.

Suggested Readings
The lectures are designed to be self-contained. For those interested in more information on any topic that is covered, the instructor’s textbook (Medical Neurobiology, Oxford University Press, 2011) contains in-depth treatment of every topic covered. 

Course Format
In each week, up to 2 hours of lecture and laboratory exercises will be presented. Videos will be broken up into chunks of 5-10 minutes, with a short quiz at the end of each chunk to ensure that students understand the material. Each week, the instructor will lead a Discussion Forum to explore the neurobiology of an item related to the material presented that week; the item can be a current event, YouTube video, or the like. Students will submit candidate items that will then be voted up or down by all students. Prior to the Forums, students will work together to come up with a neurobiological understanding of the chosen item. The instructor will then discuss the students’ ideas during a live-session.

Multiple choice tests will ensure that students understand the material presented each week. For those interested, challenge exams will ask students to apply the neurobiology learned that week to novel problems. A final exam will demonstrate to those who complete the course how much they have learned.

FAQ
What do I need to know to be able to take this course?

Nothing! There are no prerequisites for this course. All you need is curiosity.

What kind of credit can I receive for taking this course?

Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor. Students that complete all tests including challenge exams will receive a Statement of Accomplishment with Distinction.

Who should enroll in this course?

The target audience is the non-neurobiologist who is interested in the brain. The course is intended for people in all walks of life who feel drawn to the brain and nervous system. For those without a background in biology or those who may need a refresher, captioning will explain terms and concepts of basic biology.

Will this course require a belief in evolution?

Understanding any part of biology, the nervous system included, is greatly aided by looking at the natural history involved. For example, to understand motion sickness, it is critical to remember that our ancestors did not have vehicles and had to propel themselves in order to move through the world. This type of approach is termed ethological. Viewing neurobiology through the lens of evolution is similarly useful. For example, the topography of the spinal cord – arms, trunk, legs and then saddle (buttocks and perineum) – is derived from the four-legged body plan of our ancestors rather than from the bipedal plan of humans. Ethological and evolutionary perspectives will be used to advantage throughout the course.

What are the differences between Neurobiology and Neuroscience, and Neurology and Psychiatry?

Neurobiology and Neuroscience are terms that refer to the basic study of nervous systems in all types of animals from sea urchins to worms, sea slugs, flies, fish, turtles, and chickens to mice, rats, monkeys and humans. The terms are largely synonymous with Neurobiology having a more biological connotation and Neuroscience being a term that is more inclusive of connections with fields outside of biology such as computer science, artificial intelligence, linguistics, economics and so on.

Neurology and Psychiatry are medical fields that concern disorders of the human nervous system. The line between Neurology and Psychiatry is blurry. Generally speaking, disorders of mood and thought (e.g. depression, schizophrenia) are considered psychiatric whereas disorders of movement (e.g. paralysis, Parkinson’s disease), perception (e.g. blindness, chronic pain), and communication (language) fall under the rubric of neurology.

This course will focus on the neurobiology of modern human life: how our nervous system works on a day-to-day basis. Beyond looking at how the nervous system operates normally, we will also cover the common ways that the nervous system fails, topics that draw primarily from Neurology as well as from Psychiatry.</field>

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Economics, psychology, and neuroscience are converging today into a unified discipline of Neuroeconomics with the ultimate aim of providing a single, general theory of human behaviour.

Neuroeconomics can provide economists and social scientists with a deeper understanding of how they make their own decisions, and how others decide. Are we hard-wired to be risk-adverse or risk-takers? How is a “fair decision” evaluated by the brain? Is it possible today to predict the purchasing intentions of a consumer? Can we modulate economic behaviour affecting the brain?

Neuroscience allied to psychology and economics have powerful models and evidence to explain why we make a decision… and whether it is rational or not. Decision-making in financial markets, trust and cooperation in teams, consumer persuasion, will be central issues in this course in neuroeconomics. You will be provided with the most recent evidence from brain-imaging techniques (PET, fMRI and TMS), and you will be introduced to the explanatory models behind them.

The course will start by discussing the foundations of neuroeconomics and the neuroanatomy of the brain (Module I: “How the brain works”).

Module II (“How the brain decides”) then focuses on the core building block of neuroeconomics: decision theory. In a simple way, you will be presented with the main theories accounting for how individuals decide, supported by key empirical studies.

The next module will study the balance between rationality and emotions (Module III: “How the brain feels”): how our emotions interfere with our so-called rational judgments.

Module IV (“Society of brains”) focuses on society: how groups and the social environment interact with individual decision-making. This module will have strong implications for marketing, public policy and public education.

Course Syllabus
Module I: “How the Brain works”

Week 1. Introduction.  Introduction to the course, historical overview of the field.

Week 2. Brain anatomy and functions. Introduction to neuroscience, brain anatomy and brain functions. Measuring brain activity:  Brain-imaging (EEG, MEG, fMRI), brain stimulation (TMS), cell recording, data visualization, interpretation of the results.

Module II: “How the Brain decides”

Week 3. Introducing brain models of decision making and choice. Neuro-cognitive models of the choice: comparison with formal models of decision making.

Week 4. Neural representation of the subjective value, basal ganglia and choice value.

Week  5. Brain mechanisms of risky choice and ambiguity.

Module III: “How the Brain feels”

Week 6. Economic rationality and emotions. How emotions can prevent or actually promote rational decision making, according to evolutionary psychology.

Week 7. Dual processing. Two systems in the brain: Fast, automatic, emotional processes versus slower, controlled, cognitive processes.

Module IV: “Society of Brains”

Week 8. The social brain. Social perception, empathy, social preferences; theory of mind, inequity, persuasion, conformity.

Week 9. Taking an evolutionary perspective: the ‘economic animal.’ Primate studies of economic behaviour. Animals’ economy - a model of human economy. 

Recommended Background
The course introduces an interdisciplinary perspective on economic choice behaviour. We are looking for students who want to go the extra mile in understanding decision making from a biological perspective; eager to learn more about how neuroscience can revolutionize economics. The course is relevant for students from economics, business administration,  neuroscience, psychology and the social sciences in general.

Suggested Readings
Although the lectures are designed to be self-contained, we recommend (but do not require) that students refer to the books:

•         selected chapters from the Handbook of “Neuroeconomics: Decision Making and the Brain”  by Paul Glimcher et al. (2008 or 2013).

•         selected chapters from handbooks on anatomy and brain imaging methods

•         journal articles in neuroeconomics, selected for their clarity and accessibility
Course Format
This is a 9-week course. At the end of each lecture video, there are 2-3 questions for review. Each lecture has notes. At the end of the course you will be asked to complete a final project. It will consist of a short written report that focuses on the major discussion topics in neuroeconomics.  During the course, you will be asked to participate in discussions.
FAQ
1. Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?

Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.



2. What is the coolest thing I&#39;ll learn if I take this class?

You will get an opportunity to dramatically change your view on mechanisms of human choices. Furthermore, you will join a new provocative society of leading scientists combining neuroscience, economics and psychology to build a revolutionary theory of human behavior.</field>

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
“Perhaps a man really dies when his brain stops, when he loses the power to take in a new idea.” --George Orwell

Neuroethics might well be the most rapidly growing area within bioethics; indeed, in some respects neuroethics has grown as an independent field, with its own journals, professional society and institutional centers. This growth over the past decade is partly attributable to the growth of neuroscience itself and to the challenging philosophical and moral questions it inherently raises. A 2012 Royal Society report observes that “(a)n increasingly mechanistic understanding of the brain raises a host of ethical, legal, and social implications. This has laid the foundation for the emergent field of Neuroethics, which examines ethical issues governing the conceptual and practical developments of neuroscience. Irrespective of their validity, even the claims that modern neuroscience entails the re-examination of complex and sensitive topics like free will, consciousness, identity, and responsibility raises significant ethical issues. As such, neuroethics asks questions that extend beyond the usual umbrella of biomedical ethics.” This course will, therefore, consider the new knowledge and ways of learning about the brain from scientific and ethico-legal and social standpoints. We will examine the core themes of neuroethics, including cognitive enhancement, the nature of the self and personhood, neuroimaging and privacy, and the ways that all these themes are brought together in matters affecting national security.

	<field name="course_intro">A New History for a New China, 1700-2000: New Data and New Methods, Part 1
The purpose of this course is to summarize some of the new directions in Chinese history and Chinese social science produced by the discovery and analysis of new historical data, in particular archival documents and datasets, and to organize this knowledge in a framework that encourages learning about China in comparative perspective.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Our course demonstrates how a new scholarship of discovery is redefining what is singular about modern China and modern Chinese history. The current understanding of human history and social theory is based largely on Western experience or on non-Western experience seen through a Western lens. This course offers alternative perspectives derived from Chinese experience during the last three centuries. We present specific case studies of the new scholarship of discovery divided into three independent parts, which means that students can take any Part without prior or subsequent attendance of the other Parts. Part 1 addresses the issue of “Who Gets What” and covers sequentially inequality and education, education and social mobility, social mobility and wealth distribution, and wealth distribution and regime change. Part 2 turns to the related issue of “Who Survives” and includes studies of inequality and population behavior, population behavior and human development, human development and social organization, and social organization and social stratification. Part 3 deals with issues of identification and motivation and presents studies of religion and gender, ethnicity, and nationalism from late imperial times to the present-day.

Our class eschews the standard chronological narrative arc for an analytic approach that focuses on specific discoveries and on how these new facts complicate our understanding of comparative societies, human behavior, and the construction of individual and group identities. That being said, while we do not emphasize the temporal narratives of late imperial, early modern and contemporary China, we of course also discuss change over time as China progresses from a largely domestic imperial history to the shared stories of imperialism and semi colonialism, communism and collectivization, and reform and globalization.

Course Syllabus
Part 1 will cover the following subjects:

Social Structure and Education in Late Imperial China
Education and Social Mobility in Contemporary China
Social Mobility and Wealth Distribution in China
Wealth Distribution and Regime Change
Recommended Background
No requirements. Everyone is welcome.
Course Format
For each subject, we present a 45-60 minute lecture, which incorporates recent, often on-going, research on these issues, and suggest 50 to 100 pages of relevant reading followed by peer mentored online discussions of the lecture and assigned reading.</field>

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Networks are everywhere. From the social connections we make on platforms like Facebook, to the technology behind the Internet upon which these sites run, they have become an integral part of our daily lives.

In this course, we will study these networks. Specifically, we will focus on understanding the fundamental principles that guide their designs and sustainability. We will see how the simplest phrases like “sharing is hard” and “crowds are wise” can summarize a vast amount of network theory, that goes into answering questions like “how does 3G work on your smartphone?” and “when can you trust an average rating on Amazon?”.  And rather than using heavy math, this course will only require basic arithmetic such as addition and multiplication. We rely on animations, analogies, and anecdotes as our pedagogical tools, in lieu of detailed equations.

Course Syllabus
The following topics will be covered during this course:
How much power does your cell phone use to transmit?
Why is WiFi slower at a hotspot?
How does Google rank webpages?
How does Netflix recommend movies?

Why Study Natural Language Processing?

Natural language processing is the technology for dealing with our most ubiquitous product: human language, as it appears in emails, web pages, tweets, product descriptions, newspaper stories, social media, and scientific articles, in thousands of languages and varieties. In the past decade, successful natural language processing applications have become part of our everyday experience, from spelling and grammar correction in word processors to machine translation on the web, from email spam detection to automatic question answering, from detecting people&#39;s opinions about products or services to extracting appointments from your email. In this class, you&#39;ll learn the fundamental algorithms and mathematical models for human language processing and how you can use them to solve practical problems in dealing with language data wherever you encounter it.</field>

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Symmetry is everywhere. In the grand scheme of things it is the blueprint by which the universe operates. We see symmetry in nature, art, architecture, science and engineering. This course explores the Beauty, Form and Function of Symmetry in common objects, then progresses to investigate tiling and tessellation, gems and crystals, and finally its indispensable role in technology. 

Walk through an urban or rural landscape and you are immersed in an endless variety of forms, often taken for granted, because our minds have evolved to perceive symmetry in our surroundings so as to accelerate the flight or fight response. Symmetry and asymmetry are also key factors that ensure the successful reproduction of plants and animals. For example, the bilateral symmetry of orchids is widely admired and this geometry is essential for insects to successfully pollinate these flowers.

This course will give you the means to address several fundamental questions.  

What tags do we recognize in decorative arrangements? 
What guidelines shape the patterns in the world around us? 
What functions do these symmetrical patterns serve? 
From looking at minerals and crystallography and also observing patterns and forms at the atomic scale, important in drug design, materials synthesis, and data storage devices, students will appreciate how today&#39;s advancement in technology, is in no small part a consequence of humankind’s increasingly sophisticated and precise manipulation of symmetry.

To amplify these ideas, you will undertake field-exercises and be introduced to specialists – botanists, artists, geomancers, historians, scientists and engineers - that work with symmetry, and who will provide their personal insights into its ‘magic’ and impact on their disciplines.

At the conclusion of this study, you will possess the tools and the motivation to look at symmetry with even greater delight, wonder and appreciation!


Important note: The course will be launched on 17 Feb 2014. Registration with Coursera for the Signature Track is now open and the closing date is 28 Feb 2014. It is highly encouraged that you enrol soon, as the 1st assessment will commence from 24th Feb 2014 to 3rd Mar 2014.



Course Syllabus
Part I: Basic Concepts of Symmetry

Week 1: ‘Recognizing Symmetry Around Us’ will refresh your intuitive appreciation of symmetry in furniture, botany and common objects and introduce the mathematics of point symmetry.
Week 2: ‘Understanding the Unit Cell’ begins by examining tessellations in architecture that will illustrate key concepts in plane symmetry including the asymmetric unit.  ‘Nature of Chirality’ discusses this key concept in symmetry and its impact on drug design and delivery.
Part II: Plane (2D) and Space (3D) Symmetry

Week 3: ‘Plane Groups’ describes the symmetry operations in 2 dimensions and the difference between ‘primitive’ and ‘centered’ unit cells illustrated using the art of Escher. ‘Nets’ examines the role of symmetry in Islamic architecture and history in the context of regular and irregular networks. 
Week 4: ‘Space Symmetry’ expands the symmetry operations to include 3 dimensional motion.  The methodology for reading and using the symmetry diagrams of the 17 plane groups and 230 space groups is introduced.
Part III: Symmetry in Crystals

Week 5: ‘Atoms in Crystal Structures’ looks the external shape of mineral crystals by visiting a geomancer. The manner in which crystal faceting reflects the internal atomic arrangements is described. ‘Polyhedral Properties’ shows that regular geometrical shapes can be derived from folding plane nets to create Platonic and Archimedean solids that often describe atomic clustering.
Week 6: ‘Planes, Directions and Unit Cell’ introduces the mathematics for describing perfect crystal structures and also the appearance of defects or asymmetry that are important aesthetically and technologically.  A laboratory tour will show the experiments used to extract crystallographic information.
Part IV: Symmetry and Technology

Week 7: ‘Trends and Substitutions’ brings together chemistry and crystallography, shows how they are inter-related and provide the means to engineer designer technological materials.  A clean room fabrication facility provides real world context for exploiting chemically-driven symmetry.
Week 8:  ‘Building Complex Structures’ looks beyond 3 dimensional symmetry to higher dimensional repetitions found in some Islamic tilings and the incommensurate crystal structures. ‘Technological and Design Implications’ returns to the everyday appearance of symmetry that can now be explored quantitatively.
 

Recommended Background

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
The course, “A Look at Nuclear Science and Technology” is aimed at scientifically inclined individuals who want to learn more about nuclear energy and the nuclear power industry. It will address subjects such as: What is nuclear energy? What is its history? Who are its heroes? Why is it controversial? How do nuclear power plants work? What about nuclear weapons? What are the stereotypes and misconceptions? We expect many students who finish this class to want to go on for further study in a closely related field.
Course Syllabus
“A Look at Nuclear Science and Technology” is an overview course that provides broad subject-area coverage to introduce students to application of theory to practical aspects of nuclear science and technology in the world today with special emphasis on commercial nuclear power. The course will begin with a general overview of nuclear physics and the practical applications covered by the field of nuclear engineering. The majority of the course will focus on the theory, design and operation of commercial nuclear power reactors. The course will also touch on contemporary issues regarding nuclear power generation including: the nuclear fuel cycle, the economics of nuclear power, and nuclear non-proliferation.

The course will begin with a grand tour of the commercial nuclear fuel cycle and power reactors so the student will have some perspective before delving into the theory that is important to understanding the unique aspects of nuclear energy. The course then will return to the fundamentals of basic nuclear physics, reactor physics, energy removal and power conversion to prepare students for in-depth looks at the theory and function of commercial nuclear power reactors.

This course is intended for students who have had little to no academic instruction in nuclear engineering. Some of my incentives to teach this class are (1) to stimulate interest and excitement about nuclear science and technology, and (2) to create a more informed citizenry on the subject of nuclear energy utilization in the future. 

Introduction – A Grand Tour of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle
Atomic and Nuclear Physics – The Einstein Connection
Nuclear Reactions and Radiation – The Life and Trials of Neutrons and the Things They Create
Radiation and Radiation Protection – Radiation and Realism
Fission Reactor Basics – Links in the Chain Reaction
Overview of Power Reactors and Nuclear Systems – Over 440 in the World and Growing
Nuclear Safety –Should I be frightened?
Radiation and Radioisotopes in the World Today
Recommended Background
Students should have had a course in physics and differential equations. Simple, first order ordinary differential equations will be used now and then.
Suggested Readings
Nuclear Engineering – Theory and Technology of Commercial Nuclear Power by Ronald Allen Knief, 2nd Edition, Taylor &amp; Francis, 1992
Additional readings to be provided
Course Format
This class will consist of lecture videos, which are between 10 and 20 minutes in length, and brief PowerPoint slides, accompanied by narration. Ungraded quiz questions will be provided for each lecture. The overall grade for the course will be based on the student’s performance on a weekly exam.

FAQ
Although I have a college degree, I don’t have a very strong background in science. Do you think I have a chance at succeeding in this class? 
Yes. I’ve structured it with you in mind.
Will I get a certificate after completing this class? 
Students who successfully complete this class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.
What resources will I need for this class? 
You will need a computer that can access high speed Internet. While it will help to have a copy of the text by Knief (see recommended text listed above), the course materials are mostly self-contained and reading materials can be accessed on the Web or available from within the course.
What are the coolest things I’ll learn if I take this class? 
You will learn that a tiny fuel pellet less than 0.2 cubic inches will provide the energy equivalent of approximately 2,000 pounds of coal. There will be no CO2 emission from reactor operation and the volume of waste produced will be on the order of the volume of the fuel pellet.
You will learn what the real danger of radiation is. You will examine myths and misconceptions about splitting the atom to make energy.
You will learn that the old alchemist&#39;s dream of transferring one element into another is possible with nuclear transmutations.
What is the format of the class? 
The course will be essentially recorded lectures of 10 to 30 minutes with assessment material at the end of each segment. You should expect to spend 4 to 6 hours per week viewing the material, doing extra readings, participating in discussions with fellow students and taking the assessments.
What about timing?  Can I take this self-paced? 
Probably not. There will be due dates for each assessment to keep us moving forward together. So you won’t be able to wait until the last week and do all the material in a day or two. We expect that you will be committed to work on the course each week as you would for any other college class.
Can we contact the professor? 
The professor will be nearby and monitoring the course. If problems come up, he will address them in the Announcement section or in the discussion forum. The discussion forum is an important part of the course and much of the learning happens when you interact with other students, so I encourage you to do that.

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This course covers the basics of normal nutrition for optimal health outcomes and evidence-based diets for a variety of diseases. Participants will learn the fundamentals of nutrition science and build upon these to explore emerging diet therapies, to analyze nutrition research and to plan well-balanced meals and dietary interventions for both healthy individuals and those with a number of diseases and health conditions. 
Course Syllabus
Module 1:         Introduction to Nutrition Science
 
If you are what you eat, you should probably know something about how to eat! In this introductory module, you will learn about the field of nutrition science, the basics of nutrition research and some important terms that will set the stage for the remainder of the class. This module ends with a global look at meal planning guides and tools and provides you with an opportunity to determine your own individual nutrient needs.
 
Module 2:         Heart Disease
 
Heart disease is the number one cause of death around the world. Your food choices make a difference when it comes to heart disease. This module we cover the risk factors for heart disease and explore different dietary avenues for the prevention and management of heart disease, hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension and stroke. Dietary foci include vegetarian diets, the DASH diet and the Mediterranean diet.
 
Module 3:         Diabetes
 
Globally, it is estimated that 438 million people – or roughly 8% of the world’s population – will have diabetes by 2030. This module looks at the role of nutrition in the prevention and management of pre-diabetes and Types 1, 2 and gestational diabetes. Additional topics include evidence-based recommendations for physical activity with diabetes, meal planning, carbohydrate counting and the roles of dietary fiber and the glycemic index in blood sugar control.
 
Module 4:         Cancer
 
Diet and cancer are certainly linked; but the degree to which food intake impacts the development and progression of cancer is still not entirely understood. We will look at the diet-related risk factors in cancer development as well as evidence-based guidelines for the nutritional management of cancer and treatment-related side effects. Additional emphasis is placed on emerging cancer nutrition research and debunking diet and cancer myths.
 
Module 5:         Obesity and Weight Management
 
Global statistics for obesity did not exist 50 years ago. Now, you can’t turn around without exploding obesity statistics smacking you in the face! We will explore the complex and interrelated factors that contribute to rising obesity rates, discuss various approaches to weight loss and weight maintenance and strategize for future solutions to this global epidemic.
 
Module 6:         Disorders of the GI Tract
 
A healthy digestive tract is crucial for optimal nutrition status. Impairments in any segment of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract can quickly undermine proper nutrient digestion, absorption and utilization. In this module we will look at how a healthy gut should work, and what to do when the digestive process is disrupted. Specific GI focus areas include celiac disease and gluten free foods, diverticular disease, peptic ulcer disease, inflammatory bowel disease, dysphagia, gas, constipation and malabsorptive disorders and look at the roles of dietary fiber and probiotics and prebiotics in gut health.
Recommended Background
Basic understanding of nutrition science: macronutrients, micronutrients and digestion.
Course Format
The course is divided into six modules, each covering a distinct area of nutrition science or disease state. Participants will view ten sub-topic video lectures, each one approximately 12 minutes in length and containing 1-2 embedded quiz questions. Additional outside readings, web-based resources and discussion board topics will be presented to round out the lecture material.
FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Completion after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will have the opportunity to receive a Statement of Completion signed by the instructor.

Is Continuing Education credit for practicing physicians, nurses, and dietitians available for this class?

This course will provide a coherent, understandable look at the evidence on how nutrition and physical activity impact health through lower morbidity, longevity, and quality of life.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Over 65 percent of adults and over 30 percent of children meet the classification of being overweight or obese, and with this excess weight comes numerous health conditions that include heart disease, diabetes, cancer, musculoskeletal disorders, and even impairments in cognitive function. Because in most cases the core cause of obesity and its related health conditions is a poor quality of diet and lack of sufficient physical activity, it is no surprise that to reverse this health problem a foundation of proper nutrition and sufficient physical activity is imperative. 

This course is designed to provide a foundation of nutritional knowledge to develop a sustainable pattern of healthy eating. To this will be added a foundation of knowledge related to physical activity and exercise. These two key lifestyle behaviors are then brought together under the umbrella of calorie balance, which is the understanding of how we balance the calories that we eat in our diet with the calories that we burn to sustain life and to perform all of our daily tasks and functions. 

Ultimately, this information can only be of value if individuals understand how to engage in these healthy behaviors within their daily lives when they are faced with challenges and barriers. This course will address key issues and will provide information on effective strategies for adopting and maintaining these targeted behaviors as they apply to the adoption and maintenance of a healthy lifestyle.

The resources available to individuals and society and the prices of goods in the market shape our choices - even about the food we eat and the weight at which we live. This course explores the economic motivation for consumer choice and the economic role of government in markets related to obesity.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Economics motivates consumer behavior based on preferences, relative prices, and time and money constraints.  Economics motivates the role for government based on market failure.  Obesity has been deemed a critical public health problem.  This course explores how consumer choices lead to individuals being different weights and discusses whether there is an economic rationale for government intervention in the markets most closely related to food and activity choices.  

Course Objectives 
Define the concept of consumer sovereignty 
Describe how consumers are thought to make choices based on a combination of preferences, relatively prices, and time and money constraints 
Describe economic motivations for government action in markets 
Consider arguments regarding the appropriateness of a government role in markets that are related to obesity in adults and children
Course Syllabus
Week 1: Learn some background information about economics, and learn about the epidemiology of obesity and  about direct and indirect costs; andtake a quiz to assess what you have learned; introduce yourself to the class; and begin to have discussions using economic terminology on the BBS 

Week 2: Learn about  both economic and non-economic influences on obesity;  take a quiz to assess what you have learned; and begin to apply economic logic to potential policies to change consumer behaviors 

Week 3: Learn about the limits of consumer sovereignty, how economists motivate government policies, and what some economists think about policies that have already been tried; take a quiz to assess what you have learned; and write a basic policy analysis 

Week 4: Complete the final quiz, assess the written work of your peers; and continue to discuss how incentives, information, and constraints affect individuals&#39; choices of food and activity levels and result in individuals being widely varying weights  
Recommended Background
An understanding of issues related to the health impacts of obesity or some basic microeconomics is helpful but not necessary.
Suggested Readings

The world is ageing – people are older and societies are facing hard realities. What are we to make our lives in this time of global ageing? In six weeks, we analyze critical questions about age and ageing around the world.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Growing old is discussed today in ominous terms – concerns about disease, dysfunction, and destitution are daily discussed by media and policy makers. What are individuals, families, communities and societies to make of an ageing world? We analyze contemporary topics in psychological and social ageing from a global perspective. Each week, we pose a question to be explored and discussed online. Participants are encouraged to contribute their experiences and perspectives as we create a global community to discuss age, ageing, and the science of gerontology in action. Participants will then compile a portfolio of materials they create and/or collect to address each week’s question and critically reflect their knowledge and experience throughout the course. Portfolios are then reviewed by peers at the end of the course to foster continued discourse among participants in our COURSERA community.

This course analyzes the intersection between the Olympic Games and the media and how television and other media contribute to fund, shape and disseminate the major sporting spectacle in the world: the Olympic Games.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This course allows students to explore the universe of media and their role in the construction of the Olympic Games, the greatest sporting event worldwide. After providing a general context regarding what the modern Olympic Games represent for our culture and what are the main constituents of the so called Olympic Movement, the course focuses on media as funders of the Olympics, disseminators of their values system and creators of the global image of the Games. More specifically, we will deepen into: 
The history of media and the Olympic Games
The television rights and sponsorship programs
How the media operate during the Olympics
The television production of the Olympic Games and their worldwide audiences
The opening and closing ceremonies and the symbols and rituals of the Games
The management of new media and social networking websites such as Facebook and Twitter by the Olympic Family.

Focused on Tolkien and The Lord of the Rings Online, this course explores what happens to stories and films when they are turned into online games.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Intended for both newcomers who are curious about video games and hard-core gamers who want to reflect on their passion, this course will explore what happens to stories, paintings, and films when they become the basis of massively multiplayer online games.  The Lord of the Rings trilogy—the novels, films, and video game—are our central example of how “remediation” transforms familiar stories as they move across media. 

The course is designed as a university-level English literature class—a multi-genre, multimedia tour of how literature, film, and games engage in the basic human activity of storytelling.  Our journey will enable us to learn something about narrative theory, introduce us to some key topics in media studies and cover some of the history and theory of video games.  It will also take us to some landmarks of romance literature, the neverending story that lies behind most fantasy games: J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Fellowship of the Ring, a bit of Edmund Spenser’s Faerie Queene, and poems by Keats, Tennyson, Browning, and others.

Drawing on centuries of romance narrative conventions, the twenty-first century gaming industry has become a creative and economic powerhouse.  It engages the talents of some of our brightest writers, artists, composers, computer engineers, game theorists, video producers, and marketing professionals, and in 2012, it generated an estimated $64 billion in revenue.  Anyone interested in today’s culture needs to be conversant with the ways this new medium is altering our understanding of stories.  Join me as we set out on an intellectual adventure, the quest to discover the cultural heritage of online games.

Course Syllabus
Week 1: Game on!  The history and theory of MMOs

Week 2: LOTRO and Tolkien

Week 3: Romance and realism

Week 4: Space and time in three media: novel, film, game

Week 5: Pwning Spenser’s Faerie Queene

Week 6: The Holy Grail: A good end game

Recommended Background
No background in gaming is required.  Whether you are non-gamer who is interested in understanding what video games are all about, a person who loves both popular culture and serious literature, or a guild leader who runs large raids three nights a week, this course will challenge you to think more deeply about important issues confronting our culture.

You do not have to play The Lord of the Rings Online™ (LOTRO) to enroll in this class because we will have two tracks, one for those who are able to play LOTRO and the other for people who would like to learn about video games, Tolkien, and the romance tradition but choose not to play themselves.  

LOTRO is free to play.  There is no cost to download or play in the Shire, Bree, Lone Lands, and the other regions we will be studying.  Most people who continue playing for longer than a few months choose to pay for what Turbine calls VIP status, but the free-to-play content will provide you with months of game time.  Those students who want to play LOTRO will need access to a computer capable of running the game. The computer requirements for LOTRO are detailed on the Turbine web site: http://www.lotro.com/free.php.
Suggested Readings
J. R. R. Tolkien&#39;s The Fellowship of the Ring and Peter Jackson&#39;s movie The Fellowship of the Ring are the only required works.  Students are encouraged to read the other two books in The Lord of the Rings--and to watch the movies--but the later volumes and films in the trilogy are not required.
Course Format
The course is presented through three different kinds of videos:

1.      Short lectures by the instructor.  We use this mode to convey key concepts, history, and theory.

2.      Small seminars.  In these sessions, which make up the majority of the course, I am joined by five wonderful Vanderbilt students to talk about their encounter with gaming.  Some of them are new to gaming; others have been gaming since childhood.

3.      In-game sessions.  These videos plunge you into the action of Lord of the Rings Online.  They combine in-game footage with analysis of narrative and game theory.

There will in-game, interactive assignments and written assignments, with the option of student video projects and game design projects.

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
PART OF THE WHARTON FOUNDATION SERIES 

Remember the last time you went to a restaurant. What did you expect from that restaurant? You wanted to find something on the menu that you liked, you wanted the meal to be prepared according to high quality standards, you wanted to get it quickly and didn’t want to pay too much money for it. Now, remember the last time you went to a doctor’s office or a hospital. What did you want the doctors and nurses to do? You wanted them to provide the right care for you, you wanted the care delivered with great quality, you wanted to get the care quickly, and you (or your insurance) didn’t want to pay too much for it. 

Put differently, the management skills that you need to run the operations of a restaurant are the same that you need to run a hospital. And these are the skills you will learn in this course. Specifically, you will learn how to improve productivity, increase responsiveness, provide more choice to the customer, and deliver higher quality standards. In short, you will learn how to analyze business processes and how to improve them. Along the way, you will learn about topics such as Lean Operations, Six Sigma, and the Toyota production system, you will hear about bottlenecks, flows rates, and inventory levels. And, much, much more.

Course Syllabus
The course is broken up into six modules: 

Introduction
Process analysis
Productivity
Responsiveness
Quality
Product variety
There are two tracks in this course, an academic track and a practitioner track. For the academic track, the final grade is determined based on five homework assignments and a final exam. It is also possible to complete the course via a practitioner track, which requires the completion of a real world application project.
Recommended Background
The course is designed for business school students and executives. There are no academic prerequisites for the course; this is not a math course and nothing done in this course requires more than high school math. 
  
This course will be helpful to students that:
are preparing for their career in business and want to lay some foundations
are in the middle of their career and have some real problems to solve right now
Suggested Readings
Although the class is designed to be self-contained, students wanting to expand their knowledge beyond what we can cover in this one-quarter class or who want more practice problems, more in-depth explanations, or more math should look at the following book: 
 Cachon, Gerard, Christian Terwiesch, Matching Supply with Demand: An Introduction to Operations Management  , 3rd edition, Irwin - McGraw Hill, 2012 (ISBN 978-0073525204, 507 pages)
Course Format
The class will consist of lecture videos, which are between 7 and 12 minutes in length. Many of them contain 1-2 integrated quiz questions per video. There will also be standalone homeworks that are not part of video lectures. The course ends with a final exam. For the practitioner track, students need to complete a course project along the way which, in each week, applies the learnings from the modules to a real world problem. 
FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?
Contingent on academic performance, you will get a Statement of Accomplishment stating that you completed this course. However, no certificate will be given from Wharton / Penn and successful completion of this course does not make you a Wharton / Penn alumnus.

What resources will I need for this class?
You will need access to a spreadsheet program, some paper, and a pencil. Nothing more.

What is the coolest thing I&#39;ll learn if I take this class?
You will look at the world with different eyes - you will start to detect bottlenecks, identify productivity wastes, and come up with ideas to improve business processes. A known side effect of these skills is that you might drive friends, family, or co-workers crazy when you point to their improvement opportunities...

What does a typical class look like?
In a typical video session, I will introduce a small case to outline a problem in an operation. That could be a hospital, a restaurant, a bank, a call center, or whatever other setting. We will then use the setting of the case to discuss various performance measures as well as what one might want to do to improve the operation.

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Optimization technology is ubiquitous in our society. It schedules planes and their crews, coordinates the production of steel, and organizes the transportation of iron ore from the mines to the ports. Optimization clears the day-ahead and real-time markets to deliver electricity to millions of people. It organizes kidney exchanges and cancer treatments and helps scientists understand the fundamental fabric of life, control complex chemical reactions, and design drugs that may benefit billions of individuals.

This class is an introduction to discrete optimization and exposes students to some of the most fundamental concepts and algorithms in the field. It covers constraint programming, local search, and mixed-integer programming from their foundations to their applications for complex practical problems in areas such as scheduling, vehicle routing, supply-chain optimization, and resource allocation.

An introductory lecture to the course can viewed here.

In this introductory course, you will learn multiple theories of organizational behavior and apply them to actual cases of organizational change.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
It is hard to imagine living in modern society without participating in or interacting with organizations. The ubiquity and variability of organizations means there is ample room for complexity and confusion in the organizational challenges we regularly face. Through this course, students will consider cases describing various organizational struggles: school systems and politicians attempting to implement education reforms; government administrators dealing with an international crisis; technology firms trying to create a company ethos that sustains worker commitment; and even two universities trying to gain international standing by performing a merger. 

Each case is full of details and complexity. So how do we make sense of organizations and the challenges they face, let alone develop means of managing them in desired directions? While every detail can matter, some matter more than others. This is why we rely on organizational theories -- to focus our attention and draw out relevant features in a sensible way. 

Through this course you will come to see that there is nothing more practical than a good theory. Every week, you’ll learn a different organizational theory, and it will become a lens through which you can interpret concrete organizational situations. Armed with a toolset of theories, you will then be able to systematically identify important features of an organization and the events transforming it – and use the theories to predict which actions will best redirect the organization in a desired direction.

Suggested Readings
We will soon be offering a textbook customized for this course. All of the required readings will come from this textbook. Supplemental readings are mostly open source materials that can be found through the web. Although the lectures are designed to be self-contained, the syllabus lists readings throughout the course for those who wish to write papers and complete the advanced track requirements. Please see the syllabus for more details.
Course Format
Each week, there will be a series of short lectures, followed by interactive assessments that refer to the weekly readings on an organizational theory and case. In addition, there will be a forum where students post questions, respond to others, and “like” questions they want answered. Each week I will record and post on-line the discussion of highly rated forum questions (screen-side chat). A final exam will review all the prior weeks material. Students wishing to take the advanced track will be able to perform additional tasks that involve more reading, critical reflection, and application of the materials. In particular, they will be able to write short papers and conduct peer evaluations of one another’s work.

This course, orgchem1b, together with its prerequisite, orgchem1a are equivalent to a first-semester organic chemistry course; these courses and the subsequent courses (orgchem2a and orgchem2b) are especially suited for students in agricultural, nutritional and biological sciences, as well as premedical, predental, and preveterinary programs.

Course Format
Content is delivered via 5-minute videos we call webcasts. Webcasts of a related theme, along with a set of PDF lecture notes, constitute a lesson. There are 20 lessons in the course. Students are expected to watch and study these materials independently, much as they would study a traditional textbook. We encourage students to comment with feedback or questions via the discussion board. 

Bundled with each lesson are problems designed to help students test their understanding of webcast material and apply their knowledge to new situations. All problems in the course are delivered to students electronically and machine graded with real-time feedback. Problems of the Day are covered by instructors during class time and emphasize the acquisition of skills, strategies, and attitudes for heuristic (non-algorithmic) problem solving. Pressure Point Problems, or &quot;P3s,&quot; are more difficult, timed problems that help students prepare for exam situations. Because training effective problem solvers is one of our primary goals, we strongly emphasize tackling and understanding the problems associated with each lesson. 

Placing lecture contents online has allowed us to use class time almost exclusively to sharpen students&#39; problem solving abilities. During discussion sessions, students and instructors communicate online through web-based conferencing technology. Using this technology, we are able to run discussion sessions for large numbers of students while maintaining an interactive, engaging learning environment. In all discussion sessions, the emphasis is on student activity and participation.

Course Format
Each week of the course includes three lessons. A lesson is a set of short videos (webcasts) and reading materials centered on a particular topic. Each lesson includes several webcasts, but videos are generally less than ten minutes in length. Watch the webcasts and look over the reading materials for each lesson—this includes tackling the interactive problems linked from these materials! If you have questions or concerns about the content of a lesson, or if you’d like to help your peers, visit the discussion forums. Once you feel comfortable with all three lessons for a week, attempt the week’s quiz.

Because training effective problem solvers is one of our primary goals, we strongly emphasize tackling and understanding all of the quiz problems.
FAQ

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Over the past two decades, astronomers have discovered over a thousand planets around nearby stars.  Based on our current knowledge, it seems likely that there are millions of stars in the Galaxy that host Earth-sized planets in Earth-like orbits. What is the range of conditions for these planets to host life? In this course, students will engage with a wide range of concepts in astronomy, biology, chemistry, geology and physics with a focus on developing the background they will use need to think further about this profound question. We will explore the origin and evolution of  life on Earth, particularly in extreme environments, the properties of planets and moons in our Solar System,  the properties of stars and the newly discovered extrasolar planets.

Course assignments include two short papers describing proposed space missions to study nearby planets and to search for extrasolar planets and a final paper. In the final paper, students will have an opportunity to invent their own planetary system and describe it in terms of either the astronomy of how it was discovered, the properties of their planet and its host star, or the biology of life in the system. Papers will be circulated and evaluated by fellow students as part of the learning experience in the course; this will provide opportunities to develop students&#39; abilities to think like a scientist by applying principles of scientific thinking, to learn new ideas from other students, and to creatively make new connections across different sciences and parts of the course.

Develop a greater appreciation for how the air, water, land, and life formed and have interacted over the last 4.5 billion years.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This course focuses on a basic science understanding that demonstrates how the processes on Earth (including biological processes) lead to natural climate changes that have shaped the planet and the path of evolution. Students are challenged to think of the Earth as an integrated system made up on water, air, ice, land, and life.  

For example, students learn that the Gulf Stream is not the cause of western Europe’s temperate climate. They also learn that the rise of oxygen in the atmosphere 2.5 billion years ago produced massive extinctions of life on Earth that forever altered the dominant types of single-celled life.  Students are exposed to how new scientific discoveries are made through the observations that led to plate tectonics, how the Moon formed, and why dinosaurs went extinct.

Recommended Background
There is no recommended background content.  The course is open to anyone.  
Suggested Readings
There are no specific required texts.  Any required reading will be provided to you.
Course Format
In addition to video lecture segments lasting no more than 30 minutes at a time, the students will be taken on video geologic field trips across the world and tours within the Manchester Museum’s collections (both on display and behind-the-scenes) where course content will be brought to life.  

Another highlight of the course will be an interactive web game that will allow the students to build their own Earth.  The students will pick the locations of continents and other parameters (e.g., axial tilt, solar input), and a simplified climate model simulation will produce the resulting atmospheric and oceanic circulation, as well as ice sheets.  Students can explore how different configurations of continents and mountain ranges changes the global circulation and extent of polar ice caps.


FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.

What resources will I need for this class?
For this course, all you need is an Internet connection, copies of the texts (most of which can be obtained for free), and the time to think deeply about how the Earth has developed over 4.5 billion years.

What is the coolest thing I&#39;ll learn if I take this class? The rising Himalayas 30-60 million years ago led to a gradual cooling of the planet, culminating in the most recent Ice Age.
OK, that was cool.  Can I have another one?
Without life on Earth, there would be less than half of the existing types of minerals on the planet.</field>

	<field name="course_intro">Mechanics: Motion, Forces, Energy and Gravity, from Particles to Planets
Mechanics is the basis of much of physics, engineering and other technological disciplines. It begins by quantifying motion, and then explaining it in terms of forces, energy, momentum and forces including gravity. This allows us to analyse the operation of many familiar phenomena around us, but also the mechanics of planets, stars and galaxies.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Most of the phenomena in the world around you are, at the fundamental level, based on physics, and much of physics is based on mechanics. You will understand with greater depth many of the wonders around you in everyday life, in technology, in the universe at large. That, in turn, will lead you to look further and deeper into the world and the universe around you. Meanwhile, we think you&#39;ll have some fun, too.

This course uses rich multimedia tutorials to present the material: film clips of key experiments, animations and worked example problems, all with a friendly narrator. You&#39;ll then do a range of interesting problems to practise what you&#39;ve learnt, and for assessment. You will use your ingenuity to come up with two experimental investigations using simple, everyday materials (plus a computer). 

Course Syllabus
Week one: Introducing physics, mechanics and this course. And taking you through a range of tools needed for physics (and for much of science): units, scientific notation, dimensions, vectors, graphing quantities, significant figures, handling errors. (The course can be taken without calculus, but calculus is introduced in one of the toolkit resources provided)

Week two: Motion in one dimension. Especially analysing motion with constant velocity or constant acceleration. Frames of reference and relative motion

Week three: Kinematics in two dimensions including the motion of projectiles and motion in a circle

Week four: Newton&#39;s laws of motion

Week five: Weight vs mass. Contact forces, their normal and frictional components. Hooke&#39;s law and springs.

Week six: Newton&#39;s second law in terms of kinetic energy. Introducing potential and internal energy. Conservation laws. Energy transformation and power

Week seven: Newton&#39;s second law in terms of momentum. Collisions and conservation of momentum

Week eight: Newton&#39;s law of universal gravitation. Gravitational potential energy and escape velocity. Kepler&#39;s laws and the motion of satellites, planets and galaxies.


Recommended Background
You will need some simple high-school mathematics: arithmetic, a little algebra, quadratic equations, the sine, cos and tan functions from trigonometry. The course does not use calculus. However, we do provide a toolkit resource introducing the calculus that would accompany this course if it were taught in a university.
Suggested Readings
The course, with its various tool-kit resources, is self-contained. We also provide a large set of on-line learning resources for introductory physics, called Physclips.
Course Format
Each week has one multimedia tutorial. Each is less than half an hour. They contain film clips of key experiments, animations, development of material and worked examples. Every few minutes, they pause for a few short questions where you test that you have understood and, if necessary, you can retrace your steps with no penalty. You can also access a &#39;frequent problems&#39; resource, some of the &#39;toolkit&#39; resources provided and the bulletin board. At the end of each tutorial is a set of longer questions where you will demonstrate what you have learned, for assessment. 

During the course, you will undertake two experimental investigations. Here, you will use your ingenuity to conduct experiments using simple, easily found objects, plus a computer. Experimental reports will be assessed by three of your peers and, in return, you will assess three others.


FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class? Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.  
What resources will I need for this class? You&#39;ll need a computer with an internet connection. Pen and paper for drawing diagrams and doing calculations. Either a calculator or the calculator feature on your computer. For the experimental investigations, some small items that you can probably find around you. You may wish to use a movie camera, such as those found in many computers or phones, and movie editing software such as can be downloaded for free from the internet, but this is optional. You will need curiosity and enthusiasm. Ideally, you&#39;ll have the time and the enthusiasm to join the community on the bulletin boards.
How does this course compare with a high school or university physics course? It&#39;s at the level of a good, senior high school course. It&#39;s also at the level of what might be called a &#39;fundamentals&#39; course at university: a course designed for students who have never done physics before and who don&#39;t have a good background in mathematics. Of course, mechanics is only one part of physics. A first year university course would usually include, over two semesters, introductions to mechanics, thermal physics, waves and sound, electricity and magnetism, optics and a little introduction to quantum physics and relativity.
Can I do it without calculus? Absolutely, We do provide a tool-kit resource on calculus for those who would like to see a more elegant version of a few of the derivations. However, you do not need calculus for this course.
Does it have relativity in it? There&#39;s a little bit: what we call Galilean relativity. None of Einstein&#39;s relativity. However, if you&#39;re interested, we do provide a simple introduction to Einstein&#39;s special theory of relativity on Physclips.
What about the other topics I need in high school physics? High school physics usually starts with mechanics. Once you have used some of our tool-kit resources to do problems the way a physicist does, you&#39;ll be better prepared for other topics. Further, we provide other rich-media learning materials for high school physics on our site Physclips.
Will it prepare me for a university first year course? Definitely, First year physics at university usually starts with mechanics. It will be studied at a deeper level than this course (how much deeper depends on which level you take). This course will get you off to a flying start. 
Will I be able to break bricks on my chest and climb walls like the man in the teaser video? We recommend that you don&#39;t try this. If you use this course as an introduction to studying engineering, however, you may end up in a situation where people&#39;s lives depend on your understanding of mechanics.
Who else will be doing this course? Good question! We don&#39;t know yet, but we expect to have a lot of good senior high school students taking it as university preparation, and also some university students taking it to help them with on-campus courses in which they are also enrolled.
What is the coolest thing I&#39;ll learn if I take this class? Most of the phenomena in the world around you are, at the fundamental level, based on physics, and much of physics is based on mechanics. You will understand with greater depth many of the wonders around you in everyday life, in technology, in the universe at large. That, in turn, will lead you to look further and deeper into the world and the universe around you. Meanwhile, we think you&#39;ll have some fun, too.</field>

	<field name="course_intro">Programmed cell death
Billions of cells in the body die every day. How and why do these cells die? If you want to know the answers to these questions and if you also would like to know how scientists figured them out, this course might interest you.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
In this course, you will learn about the conserved, molecular machinery that eliminates cells through programmed cell death type I, also referred to as ‘apoptosis’. Through apoptosis many cells are eliminated from our body during development and throughout adult life, and deregulated apoptosis can lead to various diseases such as cancer and auto-immune diseases. Rather than just telling you about the molecular machinery of apoptosis and how it works to kill cells, I will walk you through and discuss with you the critical experiments that led to the discovery of the key components of this molecular machinery and the mechanisms through which they function. I will also discuss how apoptosis research can help to develop novel therapeutics and consider the questions that remain open in the field.

The course will cover the following topics:

1.      Introduction to programmed cell death and apoptosis

2.      The BCL-2 family of proteins

3.      Apaf proteins

4.      Caspases

5.      Mechanisms that regulate apoptosis

6.      Non-apoptotic functions of components of the central apoptosis machinery

7.      Diseases caused by deregulated apoptosis

Recommended Background
A basic understanding of genetics and molecular and cell biology would be advantageous.
Course Format
This course will consist of weekly video lectures, which will contain 2-3 integrated quiz questions per video. At the conclusion of every second week, there will be a graded quiz on the course material:

- Week 2: Quiz on Weeks 1 and 2 (30%)
- Week 4: Quiz on Weeks 3 and 4 (30%)
- Week 6: Cumulative exam covering all material (40%)

What are Probabilistic Graphical Models?

Uncertainty is unavoidable in real-world applications: we can almost never predict with certainty what will happen in the future, and even in the present and the past, many important aspects of the world are not observed with certainty. Probability theory gives us the basic foundation to model our beliefs about the different possible states of the world, and to update these beliefs as new evidence is obtained. These beliefs can be combined with individual preferences to help guide our actions, and even in selecting which observations to make. While probability theory has existed since the 17th century, our ability to use it effectively on large problems involving many inter-related variables is fairly recent, and is due largely to the development of a framework known as Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs). This framework, which spans methods such as Bayesian networks and Markov random fields, uses ideas from discrete data structures in computer science to efficiently encode and manipulate probability distributions over high-dimensional spaces, often involving hundreds or even many thousands of variables. These methods have been used in an enormous range of application domains, which include: web search, medical and fault diagnosis, image understanding, reconstruction of biological networks, speech recognition, natural language processing, decoding of messages sent over a noisy communication channel, robot navigation, and many more. The PGM framework provides an essential tool for anyone who wants to learn how to reason coherently from limited and noisy observations.

In this class, you will learn the basics of the PGM representation and how to construct them, using both human knowledge and machine learning techniques; you will also learn algorithms for using a PGM to reach conclusions about the world from limited and noisy evidence, and for making good decisions under uncertainty. The class covers both the theoretical underpinnings of the PGM framework and practical skills needed to apply these techniques to new problems.
Course Syllabus
Topics covered include:

The Bayesian network and Markov network representation, including extensions for reasoning over domains that change over time and over domains with a variable number of entities
Reasoning and inference methods, including exact inference (variable elimination, clique trees) and approximate inference (belief propagation message passing, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods)
Learning parameters and structure in PGMs
Using a PGM for decision making under uncertainty.
There will be short weekly review quizzes and programming assignments (Octave/Matlab) focusing on case studies and applications of PGMs to real-world problems:

Credit Scoring and Factors
Modeling Genetic Inheritance and Disease
Markov Networks and Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
Inference: Belief Propagation
Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Image Segmentation
Decision Theory: Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia
Conditional Random Field Learning for OCR
Structure Learning for Identifying Skeleton Structure
Human Action Recognition with Kinect

FAQ
Will I get a statement of accomplishment after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a statement of accomplishment signed by the instructor.

What are the pre-requisites for the class?
You should be able to program in at least one programming language and have a computer (Windows, Mac or Linux) with internet access (programming assignments will be conducted in Matlab or Octave). It also helps to have some previous exposure to basic concepts in discrete probability theory (independence, conditional independence, and Bayes&#39; rule).

What textbook should I buy?
Although the lectures are designed to be self-contained, students wanting to expand their knowledge beyond what we can cover in a one-quarter class can find a much more extensive coverage of this topic in the book &quot;Probabilistic Graphical Models&quot;, by Koller and Friedman, published by MIT Press. MIT Press has generously provided a discount code (DKPGM12)  for students enrolled in this course.

How difficult is the class?
This class does require some abstract thinking and mathematical skills. However, it is designed to require fairly little background, and a motivated student can pick up the background material as the concepts are introduced. We hope that, using our new learning platform, it should be possible for everyone to understand all of the core material.</field>

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
What is the origin of our universe? What are dark matter and dark energy? What is our role in the universe as human agents capable of knowledge? What makes us intelligent cognitive agents seemingly endowed with consciousness? 

Scientific research across both the physical sciences and the cognitive sciences has raised pressing questions for philosophers. The goal of this course is to introduce you to some of the main areas and topics at the key juncture between philosophy and the sciences. The course is structured around two broad areas: 

Philosophy and the Physical Sciences
Philosophy and the Cognitive Sciences 

Each week we will introduce you to some of these important questions at the forefront of scientific research. We will explain the science behind each topic in a simple, non-technical way, while also addressing the philosophical and conceptual questions arising from it. Areas you’ll learn about will include:

Philosophy of cosmology, where we’ll consider questions about the origin and evolution of our universe, the nature of dark energy and dark matter and the role of anthropic reasoning in the explanation of our universe.
Philosophy of psychology, among whose issues we will cover the evolution of the human mind and the nature of consciousness.
Philosophy of neurosciences, where we’ll consider the nature of human cognition and the relation between mind, machines, and the environment. 

Learning Objectives
Gain a fairly well-rounded view on selected areas and topics at the intersection of philosophy and the sciences

Understand some key questions, and conceptual problems arising in the natural sciences and cognitive sciences.

Develop critical skills to evaluate and assess these problems. 

Course Syllabus
Week 0. Introduction to the course 
(Michela Massimi and Duncan Pritchard)

PART I. PHILOSOPHY AND THE PHYSICAL SCIENCES

Week 1. The origin of our universe 

(Michela Massimi and John Peacock)

How did our universe form and evolve? Was there really a Big Bang, and what came before it? In this class, we take you through the history of contemporary cosmology and we look at how scientists arrived at the current understanding of our universe. We look at the history of astronomy, with the nebular hypothesis back in the eighteenth century, and in more recent times, Einstein’s general relativity and the ensuing cosmological models. Finally, we explain the current Standard Model and early universe cosmology and the experimental evidence behind it.  

Week 2. What are dark matter and dark energy? 

(Michela Massimi and John Peacock) 

According to the currently accepted model in cosmology, our universe is made up of 5% of ordinary matter, 25% cold dark matter, and 70% dark energy. But what kind of entities are dark matter and dark energy? In this class, we take you through a fascinating journey at the frontiers of contemporary cosmology and particle physics. We also look at alternative theories that explain the same experimental evidence without recourse to the hypothesis of dark matter and dark energy and we discuss the rationale for choosing between rival research programs. 

Week 3. The Anthropic Reasoning in Philosophy and Cosmology 

(Alasdair Richmond and John Peacock)

Anthropic reasoning attempts to understand peculiarities of the physical universe via context-sensitive observers in a multiverse of different distinct universes. Anthropic reasoning can explain the dimensionality of space (and time), the ratio of gravitational and electromagnetic forces, the valency of carbon bonds, and the ages of the stars we observe in the night sky. Other anthropic explanations suggest that our universe ought to be a gigantic time machine and that we may live inside a ‘Matrix’-style computer-simulated reality. In this class, we review the problems and prospects of anthropic reasoning by drawing on cutting-edge research in galaxy formation.


PART II. PHILOSOPHY AND THE COGNITIVE SCIENCES

Week 4. Stone-age minds in modern skulls: evolutionary theory and the philosophy of mind 

(Suilin Lavelle and Kenny Smith)

This week, we will explore scientific interpretations of how our minds evolved, and some of the methodologies used in forming these interpretations.  We will relate evolutionary debates to a core issue in the philosophy of mind, namely, whether all knowledge comes from experience, or whether we have ‘inborn’ knowledge about certain aspects of our world.

Week 5. What is consciousness? 

(Mark Sprevak and David Carmel)

One of the hardest problems in science is the nature of consciousness. We know that we have consciousness. We do not just blindly process information, make discriminations, take actions. It also feels a certain way to do so from the inside. Why do creatures with brains like ours have consciousness? What makes certain bits of our mental life conscious and others not? These questions form the heart of consciousness science, an exciting field to which psychologists, neuroscientists and philosophers contribute. This session will explore these questions, and introduce some recent progress that has been made towards answering them.

Week 6. Intelligent machines and the human brain 

(Mark Sprevak and Peggy Series)

How does one make a clever adaptive machine that can recognise speech, control an aircraft, and detect credit card fraud? Recent years have seen a revolution in the kinds of tasks computers can do. Underlying these advances is the burgeoning field of machine learning and computational neuroscience. The same methods that allow us to make clever machines also appear to hold the key to understanding ourselves: to explaining how our brain and mind work. We explore this exciting new field and some of the philosophical questions that it raises.

Week 7. Embodied Cognition 

(Andy Clark and Barbara Webb) 

Cognitive Science has recently taken a strongly &#39;embodied turn&#39;, recognizing that biologically evolved intelligence makes the most of the opportunities provided by bodily form, action, and the material and social environment. This session explores the way this impacts our vision of minds, brains, and intelligent agents, and asks whether there can be a fundamental science of the embodied mind.


Recommended Background
No background required.

Course Format
The course is designed as a free open access course. The goal is to introduce learners in a simple, non-technical, accessible way to selected scientific topics across cosmology and the cognitive sciences, with their associated philosophical and conceptual issues. The course comprises seven weeks, and will be run by an interdisciplinary team of philosophers and scientists, who week-by-week will clarify the scientific background and explain the conceptual and philosophical problems.

Explore motion in the real world using modern tools and techniques (video capture and analysis, computer modeling) guided by fundamental physics principles.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
We will investigate motion in the world around us; we welcome both those who want to participate fully and those who wish to sample, cafeteria-style, the activities of this course.  Those who participate fully will experience a course that is very different in style but equivalent (at least) in core content to a traditional, on-campus, first-semester college-level introductory physics course that includes a laboratory. At the same time, those who cherry-pick selected course elements (e.g., learning the basics of video capture and analysis of motion in one’s own surroundings) will still advance their understanding of physics.    
We aim to understand and to predict motion in the real world using a small set of powerful fundamental principles. The laboratories are the backbone of this course, providing opportunities (1) to observe and to analyze motion in our own surroundings, (2) to apply fundamental principles to build explanations of the motion, and (3) to evaluate, in a constructively critical way, our own measurements and models, as well as the measurements and models of our course peers. Other course elements (lecture videos with “clicker” questions, homework) support and extend the physics explored in the laboratories.

Participants who satisfactorily complete the course will be eligible for six (6) Continuing Education Units from the American Association of Physics Teachers.

Recommended Background
No background with computer programming is required. 

Participants with nothing more than some experience in basic algebra (and a sense of adventure!) will be able to participate in at least some of the labs and other course work. 

Participants with good algebra and trigonometry skills but no background in calculus will be able to participate almost all labs and most other course work. 

Those who have some familiarity with calculus will be able to participate in all aspects of the course. 


Suggested Readings
Suggested reading assignments will be drawn from the textbook, Matter and Interactions: Volume 1 Modern Mechanics, 3rd edition, (R. Chabay &amp; B. Sherwood, Wiley). We plan to provide course participants with limited time, free access to the suggested readings. Course participants will also have the opportunity to purchase permanent access to the textbook. 
Course Format
Each lab (one approximately every two weeks) will typically (but not always) begin with observation and video capture of a particular type of motion in one&#39;s own surroundings. You will need to use a smartphone camera or a webcam to capture video. We will then use video analysis software to extract motion data. Fundamental principles will be applied to construct models (including computer models) of the observed motion. Every student will record a video lab report comparing these observations and submit it for peer review.  Course participants will evaluate the video lab reports submitted by peers. 

The lab work will be supported and extended by short lecture videos in which short conceptual &quot;clicker&quot; questions are integrated. There will be homework assignments and a final exam. 
FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment from Georgia Tech C21U.

What resources will I need for this class?  You will need:
an Internet connection
access to a computer where you can install and can use the free, open-source software we will need for video analysis and for computer modeling. It would be good if the computer you use had a spreadsheet program (at times, we will make scatter plots in spreadsheets); however, if necessary, you can use the free spreadsheet on Google docs. 
a digital camera of some type (cellphone camera, web camera, point-and-shoot digital camera) and a way to transfer images from that camera to the computer you will use for the course.</field>

Gain a rigorous introduction to physical chemistry suitable for undergraduates starting university. The course provides a unique, in-depth introduction to the three main pillars of physical chemistry: thermodynamics, kinetics and quantum mechanics.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Chemical reactions underpin the production of pretty much everything in our modern world.  But, what is the driving force behind reactions?  Why do some reactions occur over geological time scales whilst others are so fast that we need femtosecond-pulsed lasers to study them?  Ultimately, what is going on at the atomic level?  Discover the answers to such fundamental questions and more on this course in introductory physical chemistry.  

The course covers the key concepts of three of the principal topics in first-year undergraduate physical chemistry: thermodynamics, kinetics and quantum mechanics. These three topics cover whether or not reactions occur, how fast they go and what is actually going on at the sub-atomic scale.

This is a 12 week course, currently scheduled to start on Monday, April 14, 2014 and finishing on Friday, July 11. This introductory physics course is intended for physical science majors and others desiring a rigorous introduction to physics. It closely parallels the brick-and-mortar course given to the freshmen at the University of Colorado at Boulder. The course covers classical mechanics, including kinematics, dynamics, conservation laws, and applications.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This course is a rigorous introduction to classical mechanics, which is the study of forces and motion.  How does gravity control the motion of the planets around the sun or the motion of a projectile fired from a cannon?  Why does a spinning skater spin faster when she pulls her arms in?  Why is a perpetual motion machine impossible? These are the kinds of questions which can be answered with classical mechanics, which was first formulated by Isaac Newton around 1666. Classical, or Newtonian Mechanics is the oldest branch of physics, but it will never go out of style.  It remains the foundation of our understanding of the physical world and is constantly used by engineers and scientists. There is a space probe, called New Horizons, that is on its way to Pluto right now, and it will arrive on July 14, 2015, exactly on time and on target, because its path has been computed using classical mechanics, and nothing more.

Course Syllabus
Week 1:               1D motion: speed, velocity and acceleration

Week 2:               1D motion continued.   Vector Math.

Week 3:               Motion in 2D.

Week 4:               Newton’s Laws.

Week 5:               Applications of Newton’s Laws.  Friction.

Week 6:               Work and Energy.

Week 7:               Conservation of Energy.

Week 8:               Gravity and orbits.

Week 9:               Conservation of Momentum and Collisions.

Week 10:             Rotational Motion.

Week 11:             Conservation of Angular Momentum.  Static Equilibrium.

Week 12:             Simple Harmonic Motion.

Recommended Background
This course is aimed at freshmen engineering students and other physical science majors at the University-level.  Students will need a good command of algebra and trigonometry before they start this course, and some acquaintance with calculus.  Calculus is not used much in this course, and we will review that calculus that we do use.  For the student taking this course for credit at the University of Colorado, Calculus 1 is the co-requisite for the course; that is, they are required to take calc1 concurrently, if they have not already taken it.  No previous knowledge of physics is assumed, but this course is fast-paced and we cover a lot of material, so any previous high-school physics course will be very useful.  

Suggested Readings
Weekly reading assignments for this course will be from a free, online textbook, that will be posted on this site.

Course Format
This 12-week class will consist of assigned readings, plus video lectures, 3 times a week, which are video captures of the actual lectures given to freshmen engineers  at the University of Colorado at Boulder (CU) in the fall semester of 2013.  During each lecture, there are several pauses for in-class “Concept Test” questions.  There are weekly homework assignments, 2 midterm exams, and a final exam.   This online course will resemble the actual course at CU as closely as possible, with very similar homeworks and exams.</field>

Can we say that plants have senses? You will learn how plants sense their environment and how scientists study plant senses. You will be exposed to both classic and modern experiments in plant biology, and may even start to question what defines us as humans.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
For centuries we have collectively marveled at plant diversity and form—from Charles Darwin’s early fascination with stems and flowers to Seymour Krelborn’s distorted doting in Little Shop of Horrors. This course intends to present an intriguing and scientifically valid look at how plants themselves experience the world—from the colors they see to the sensations they feel. Highlighting the latest research in genetics and more, we will delve into the inner lives of plants and draw parallels with the human senses to reveal that we have much more in common with sunflowers and oak trees than we may realize. We’ll learn how plants know up from down, how they know when a neighbor has been infested by a group of hungry beetles, and whether they appreciate the music you’ve been playing for them or if they’re just deaf to the sounds around them. We’ll explore definitions of memory and consciousness as they relate to plants in asking whether we can say that plants might even be aware of their surroundings. This highly interdisciplinary course meshes historical studies with cutting edge modern research and will be relevant to all humans who seek their place in nature. This class has three main goals: 1. To introduce you to basic plant biology by exploring plant senses (sight, smell, hearing, touch, taste, balance). 2. To introduce you to biological research and the scientific method. 3. To get the student to question life in general and what defines us as humans.
Course Syllabus
Grades will be based on quizzes (on the video lectures and reading assignments), and the final exam.
Recommended Background
Curiosity about nature and our place in the world.
Suggested Readings
I will cover some of the material that is in my books WHAT A PLANT KNOWS (2012) www.whataplantknows.com  

Backed up with basic biology information found in BIOLOGY (9th Edition)
Course Format
This course will span over 7 weeks. 
In each week students will be required to watch that week&#39;s online video lectures and preform the weekly quiz.
FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by Daniel.

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Public Mental Health is the application of the principles of medicine and social science to prevent the occurrence of mental and behavioral disorders and to promote mental health of the population. This course illustrates the principles of public health applied to depressive disorder, including principles of epidemiology, transcultural psychiatry, health services research, and prevention. It is predicted that by 2020 depressive disorder will be the most important cause of disease burden in the entire world!  Every human being suffers from feeling depressed at some point or other, but only about one fifth of the population will experience an episode of depressive disorder over the course of their lives. This course illuminates the public health approach to disease, and the particular complexities of applying this approach to mental disorders, using depression as the exemplar.  

Course Syllabus
What is depression and what is depressive disorder?
How common is depressive disorder
The Global Burden of Depressive Disorder
Crosscultural variation in depression and depressive disorder
Epidemiologic research to uncover the causes of depression
Research on prevention of depression
The system of care for psychiatric disorders and depression
Suggested Readings
Public Mental Health edited by William W. Eaton is recommended, but not required.
Course Format
Instruction in this course will consist of a series of video lectures delivered by experts in the field. Each week, students will view lectures, take a quiz, and participate in online discussions. Students will also complete three peer-assessed assignments during the course.
FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?
Yes. Students who earn a sufficient final grade will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.

Will I get clinical advice in this course?
No. This course deals with principles of public health, which focuses on the health of entire populations, not individual clinical situations.

What other opportunities does the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health offer in this area?
The Summer Institute in Mental Health Research is a great opportunity to experience an intensive course of study in the field of public mental health. The Institute focuses on methodological and substantive topics in mental health and substance-use research. It is intended for working professionals or students who are interested in developing research expertise in the epidemiology of mental health and substance use disorders, the implementation and evaluation of mental health services and interventions, and/or the methodological issues encountered in mental health research in the population.</field>

This MOOC is aimed at anyone wishing to understand the basics of population health. Our aim is to prompt any participant to reconsider the decisions they make about their own health or the health of others (if they are taking the course as a health professional).</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
It is understandable that most of us consider our health care as something provided to us as an individual by other individuals or teams, for example our doctor, midwife, nurse or dentist. But in this short course we wish to introduce to you a different perspective, that of population health.

Our starting premise is that having an understanding of health from a population level can enable people to make better decisions about their own health care and can also enable health workers to make better decisions about individuals and populations within their care.

The course is led by Aneez Esmail, a general practitioner and professor from The University of Manchester, UK. Together, he and Dr Katie Reed, the Faculty eLearning lead, developed the course with contributions from a number of other academic and technical staff from the Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences.

Course Syllabus
Week 1
An Introduction to Population health, featuring Professor Aneez Esmail, Professor Michael Worboys and Dr Carsten Timmerman.

In this week we will introduce some of the main topics and concepts of population health.

Week 2
An Introduction to Epidemiology, featuring Dr Kimme Hyrich.

In this week we introduce you to the language and methods used to understand population health.

Week 3
The State of the World’s health, featuring Professor Mike Kelly.

In this week we take a snapshot of some of the big health problems facing today&#39;s world and explore their causes and consequences.

Week 4
Global Influences on Population Health, featuring Professors Tony Redmond and Mukesh Kapila.

In this week we look at the topics of migration and poverty and how they are influencing the health of our populations.

Week 5
Population Health Interventions, featuring Judith Clegg, Andrew Rogers, Dr Roger Harrison and Dr Will Welfare.

In this week we will look at ways of improving the health at a population level, including both individual and population based interventions.

Week 6
Reflection

The last week of the course features &#39;you&#39;, if you decide to take this MOOC. We will be asking students to post their own understanding of population health and how this impacts on their life and/or work. Students will be encouraged to reflect on the thoughts of other students, perhaps picking up on common geographical locations, shared professional interests or life experiences.

Each topic will also contain a number of short videos, a selection of readings, self-tests or quizzes and discussion board activities.

FAQ
1) How will I know if I can cope with the course?

If you enjoy thoughtful articles in good quality newspapers or magazines you will be able to cope with this course. To get the best out of it we do recommend that you have 1-2 hours a week to spend on it, but there is nothing to stop you dipping in and out as you are able.

2) Do I need to be a health worker or have any health or medical knowledge before I take this course?

No, you don&#39;t, the course is designed to be a general introduction to the topic for anyone who has not studied it before, so this may include students and qualified health professionals.

3) Will I be able to ask questions about my own health?

This would not be appropriate, though students may at times share some of their own experiences on the discussion boards.

4) Will I get a qualification or certificate when I finish this course?

Yes, students who work through the course and participate in most of the online activities (both self-tests and the final discussion board activity) will receive a certificate of completion.</field>

Part of the &quot;Mobile Cloud Computing with Android&quot; Specialization »
In this course--the second in a trans-institution sequence of MOOCs on Mobile Cloud Computing with Android--we will learn how to apply patterns, pattern languages, and frameworks to alleviate the complexity of developing concurrent and networked services on mobile devices running Android that connect to popular cloud computing platforms.

Preview Lectures</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
The confluence of multi-core and distributed-core processors, inexpensive mass storage, ubiquitous wireless connectivity, and commodity software platforms is driving the need for software engineers and programmers who understand how to develop concurrent and networked software for mobile devices that connect to cloud computing platforms. Despite many improvements in processors, storage, and networks, however, developing quality software on-time and on-budget remains hard. Moreover, developing high quality reusable concurrent and networked software apps and services is even harder.  The principles, methods, and skills required to develop such software are best learned by attaining mastery of patterns, pattern languages, and frameworks.

A pattern describes a reusable solution to a common problem that arises within a particular context. When related patterns are woven together they form a pattern language that defines a vocabulary and a process for the orderly resolution of software development problems. A framework is an integrated set of components that collaborate to provide a reusable architecture for a family of related apps or services.  Frameworks can also be viewed as concrete realizations of pattern languages that facilitate direct reuse of detailed design and source code.

This MOOC describes by example how to apply patterns, pattern languages, and frameworks to alleviate the complexity of developing concurrent and networked software for mobile devices via the use of object-oriented design techniques, Javaprogramming language features, and Android middleware. An extended case study project will be used throughout the MOOC to showcase pattern-oriented software design and programming techniques for concurrent and networked mobile devices and clouds.

Note: This course is part of a trans-institution sequence of MOOCs entitled Mobile Cloud Computing with Android

This MOOC and two others, taught by Dr. Adam Porter from the University of Maryland and Dr. Jules White from Vanderbilt University, have been designed to complement each other as part of the first trans-institution sequence of MOOCs taught on the Coursera platform, structured as follows:

The University of Maryland MOOC, Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems, will run from January 21st - April 28th. It focuses on the design and programming of user-facing applications.  
The first Vanderbilt MOOC in the sequence, Programming Mobile Services for Android Handheld Systems, will run from May 12th - July 6th. It focuses on middleware systems programming topics, such as synchronous and asynchronous concurrency models, background service processing, structured data management, local inter-process communication and networking, and integration with cloud-based services.  
The second Vanderbilt MOOC in the sequence, Programming Cloud Services for Android Handheld Systems, will be run from July 21st - September 29th. It focuses on how to connect Android mobile devices to cloud computing and data storage resources, essentially turning a device into an extension of powerful cloud-based services on popular cloud computing platforms, such as Google App Engine and Amazon EC2. 
The final Capstone project MOOC in the sequence will run from October 1st - November 3rd. For this first offering of the Mobile Cloud Computing with Android (MoCCA) Specialization only students in the Signature Track who receive a &quot;Verified Certificate with Distinction&quot; are eligible to enroll in the Capstone project course.
Some of the programming assignments and the iRemember integrative project for these MOOCs will be coordinated.  
If you just want to take some of the MOOCs in this sequence or take them all in different order you’re certainly welcome to do so, and you’ll still learn a lot. However, if you take all the MOOCs in this sequence in the order presented you’ll gain a deeper, end-to-end understanding of handheld systems, their applications and services, as well as their integration into the cloud.

Throughout the MOOC we&#39;ll focus on pattern-oriented software architecture, with an emphasis on concurrent and networked programming in the context of Android middleware systems programming mechanisms, such as synchronous and asynchronous concurrency models, background service processing, storage and retrieval of structured data, and local inter-process communication (IPC) and networking. We illustrate by example how key pattern and framework concepts and relationships are applied in Android Services, Content Providers, Broadcast Receivers, and various secure local and remote IPC mechanisms from both an application and infrastructure perspective. Many code examples are shown throughout using Java, with a case study project used to reify the key points throughout all the modules in this section.

The PDF versions of all the slides used in the course will be available online as the videos become available on the course website.

Recommended Background
Ideally, students who take this course will be familiar with general object-oriented design and programming concepts (such as encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism, extensibility, and the Unified Modeling Language (UML) ), fundamental object-oriented programming language features (such as classes, inheritance, dynamic binding, and generics available in Java, basic systems programming concepts (such as event handling, processes/threads, synchronization, interprocess communication, and dynamic linking), and networking terminology (such as client/server and peer-to-peer architectures, TCP/IP, and layering).  We will review object-oriented design, systems programming, and networking concepts and techniques, so students who understand how to read/write Java code examples should be fine.

Course Format
The POSA MOOC is the second course in the Mobile Cloud Computing with Android (MoCCA) Specialization. It consists of lecture videos with integrated quiz questions designed to ensure students understand the material covered in the videos.  In recognition that not all students have the same learning objectives or available time, the POSA MOOC is offered at the following two levels of engagement: 
  
Normal Track – Estimated Time Commitment:  3 – 4 Hours Per Week. Students at this level will be assessed by weekly auto-graded standalone quizzes.  This track is designed for those who wish to engage the material by taking the auto-graded quizzes, as well as participating in the online discussion forums, but who may not have the time/interest to complete the auto-/peer-graded programming assignments.  
Distinction Track – Estimated Time Commitment: 8 – 12 Hours Per Week. In addition to completing the auto-graded weekly quizzes from the Standard Track, students in this track will also complete auto-/peer-graded programming assignments, including (but not limited to) the next set of enhancements to the iRemember app begun in Dr. Porter&#39;s MOOC on Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems. The programming assignments will involve writing concurrent Android Services and Applications using its pattern-oriented frameworks written in Java, This track is designed for those students wishing to achieve mastery of the POSA MOOC material and to understand its application in realistic project context. It&#39;s also mandatory for students in the Signature Track to successfully achieve a Verified Certificate with Distinction to take the Capstone project at the end of the MoCCA Specialization.
Students need not explicitly choose which of these two Tracks to take since Statement of Accomplishment will automatically be generated corresponding to the work students successfully perform in the POSA MOOC. The final grade for the course will be calculated as follows:

Weekly quizzes (Weighting: 100% for &quot;Normal Track&quot; and 30% for &quot;Distinction Track&quot;)

Each quiz will contain a number of equally-weighted questions. You will normally have 14 days to submit the quiz.  There will be roughly eight quizzes.

Programming assignments (Weighting: 70% for &quot;Distinction Track&quot; and not applicable for &quot;Normal Track&quot;)

You will have N programming assignments (where N == 5 or 6) by the end of the course, including the iRemember app. You will have roughly 14 days to submit your solution. Each assignment will account for 1/Nth of the total programming assignment points. The total weekly assignment score will be 70% of the final course score for students taking the &quot;Distinction Track&quot;. 

Statements of Accomplishment. 

Students who earn a final grade greater than or equal to 70% will receive a Statement of Accomplishment. 

Students who wish to receive a Statement of Accomplishment with Distinction, however, must earn a Statement of Accomplishment and must successfully complete the final iRemember course project. The course project will be graded on a satisfactory/non-satisfactory basis only. 
FAQ
What are the course objectives?
Upon completing this course, students should be able to:

Recognize the inherent and accidental complexities involved with developing concurrent and networked software.
Understand how pattern-oriented software architecture techniques can and cannot help to alleviate this complexity.
Apply key pattern-oriented software architecture techniques to develop reusable concurrent and networked Android Apps using the Java object-oriented programming language and Android middleware.
Understand advanced Android middleware systems programming mechanisms and use them effectively to develop concurrent and networked software Apps and Services on Android.
Know where to find additional sources of information on how to successfully apply pattern-oriented software architecture techniques to concurrent and networked software on Android and other infrastructure platforms.
 How does this MOOC compare/contrast with courses at Vanderbilt?
This MOOC is heavily based on senior-level undergraduate courses we teach at Vanderbilt, such as the course Systems Programming for Android (CS 282). CS 282 focuses on teaching mobile software development at both a conceptual level (e.g., an understanding of software patterns, object-oriented design, and frameworks) and a practical level (e.g., experience programming Android services and applications using Java and Eclipse). Students in this course are expected to be familiar with Java and Eclipse and are capable of learning new material without significant hand-holding by the teachers and course staff. The lecture material in CS 282 is similar to the material for this MOOC (in fact, you can watch earlier versions of this material that I presented live in CS 282 via a YouTube channel). The quizzes, programming assignments, and level of feedback for the Vanderbilt courses are different, however, since the courses at Vanderbilt have many fewer students, so there&#39;s significantly more personalized guidance from the professor and TAs that can&#39;t (yet) be replicated via a MOOC.

 What are your assumptions about--and expectations for--students taking this MOOC?
As mentioned above, this MOOC is based on material we teach to senior-level undergraduate students at Vanderbilt. The lecture material is therefore intended for self-motivated students who already know Java and Eclipse (or can learn them quickly on their own) and who want to understand both the concepts and practice of mobile software development. Moreover, this material is targeted at students who want to know (1) how to program mobile software applications and services and (2) how the Android software stack is designed and implemented. Therefore, students who are looking for vocational training (e.g., having an instructor provide solutions directly or simply walk through application code projects step-by-step in the Android development environment) may not find this MOOC suitable for their needs since our goal is to help students learn how to find a solution, not simply provide a solution. Moveover, this MOOC covers a wide range of topics (especially patterns and frameworks) associated with quality mobile software development. For students who just want training we recommend others sources, such as the Android Application Development Tutorials on YouTube.

What is the most effective way to learn material covered in the course and to successfully complete the programming assignments?
We recommend watching the videos multiple times, looking for different levels of meaning in the diagrams and the examples. It&#39;s particularly important to carefully watch all the videos referenced in the programming assignment descriptions since they provide many relevant tips and insights. Likewise, we recommend reading the material pointed to by links in the slides, as well as material from the (optional) recommended reading. Naturally, participating in the online discussion forum (and ideally, a meetup group if one is available in your area) will help make the course material more engaging and personalized. Additional discussions of the programming assignment goals, requirements, and (ultimately) their solutions will be covered in &quot;Virtual Office Hours&quot; (see the FAQ entry on this topic below).

Can students take this course if they have no prior experience with Android programming or programming with Java?
Our course assumes that students are comfortable programming in Java and have some experience programming Android apps. If you don&#39;t have any Java programming background you might consider taking the course Java for Complete Beginners. Likewise, you might also benefit from the Creative, Serious and Playful Science of Android Apps MOOC, which is a novice-friendly introduction to computer science and programming Android-apps for smart-phones and tablets. No prior programming knowledge is necessary for that MOOC. We also recommend that you take Professor Adam Porter&#39;s MOOC Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems since his course provides important coverage of Android app programming that will be useful in our course. We encourage you to apply the Lazy Acquisition pattern in these MOOCs. In other words, watch the videos, keep track of what you know understand, and then use the resources available to you (e.g., via the web and the discussion forums) to fill in the gaps in your knowledge. One of the best things about MOOCs is that you can go through this material at your own pace, and there&#39;s really no penalty for retaking a MOOC if you struggle with it the first time through!

Why are there so many URL links embedded at the bottom of the slides?
Many of the topics (especially concurrency, inter-process communication, and application security) we cover in this MOOC are very technically deep. Given our limited time and resource constraints, we can&#39;t possibly address all this material in a single MOOC. Yet many students may benefit from learning more about these topics, either during or after the MOOC. Therefore, when there&#39;s additional pertinent information on a topic that we can&#39;t cover in our videos, we provide links in the PDF versions of the slides that students can download from the Video Lectures page or from the 2014 POSA MOOC wiki maintained by students. These links point to material on the web so that students can read as their interests and time permits. Following up on all the links is a rewarding, albeit time consuming task.  In fact, we term these videos &quot;Lembas Lectures&quot; since a small dose of them can keep a student nourished (intellectually) for hours! However, none of the quizzes will involve questions related to this material, so students can read them at their leisure.

What is the course staff policy for moderating and answering discussion forum threads and questions?
The course staff will endeavor to reply to thoughtful technical questions or constructive suggestions for improving the course. Often, the responses will point to other resources (such as this FAQ or to video lectures) so that students can learn the details of the solutions on their own, which is more effective pedagogically. Rants and flames (such as &quot;Android sucks,&quot; &quot;Language X is better than Java,&quot; &quot;Patterns are bad,&quot; or &quot;I hate these lectures&quot;) will be ignored and/or removed since they generate much more heat than light and disrupt the learning process. Questions posted anonymously will also receive less attention since we want to get to know the students in the MOOC so the learning environment will be more like a face-to-face course. Questions about installing or using Eclipse, the Android emulator, debugger, etc. will be addressed subject to our course staffing resources (which are extremely limited). Hopefully these types of questions will be addressed by the community of other students taking this MOOC. Step-by-step instructions on how to setup an Android development environment using Eclipse and Java are available here.

How many and what types of programming assignments will there be in this MOOC? 

We&#39;ll have a half-dozen or so programming assignments in this MOOC. The first several assignments will give students experience applying and developing concurrency mechanisms (e.g., implement a simple AtomicLong and a simple Semaphore using Java ReentrantReadWriteLock, ReentrantLock, and ConditionObject classes using the Java console environment). The next several assignments will involve applying and developing frameworks and applications that use these frameworks (e.g., a multi-threaded ping/pong Android application that will apply various GoF patterns to develop a framework that will make it easy to port the application between Android and console configurations in Eclipse). The final assignment will be an integrated project that will give students experience applying pattern-oriented concurrency mechanisms &amp; Android concurrency frameworks (e.g., AsyncTask and Handles, Runnables, and Messages) to the iRemember application that was introduced in Professor Porter&#39;s MOOC on Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems. All the source code examples and skeletons for the programming assignments will be available in this GitHub repository once the Coursera POSA MOOC officially starts.

How can students better understand and learn the material in the videos?
There is no one rate of speaking that&#39;s appropriate for all students. For students whose native language is not English--or for any students who find the rate at which the material is presented in the videos too fast to comprehend--we recommend that you decrease the rate at which you play the videos to 0.8x or slower (naturally, for material that you&#39;re already familiar with, you might want to increase the rate at which the video plays!). If you need instructions on how to change the rate of playback speed for YouTube videos please do a google search for information about the browser that you&#39;re using. Once the POSA MOOC officially starts you&#39;ll also be able to download the videos and use the media player on your computer to obtain fine-grained control over the playback speed. The Coursera platform also provides English subtitles for all the videos based on the scripts we used to record them originally. Likewise, you can enable &quot;captions&quot; via the YouTube player to view subtitles at my YouTube playlist. In addition, downloading PDF versions of the slides and reviewing them prior to watching the videos may aid with comprehension. Finally, students might also consider watching the videos multiple times, focusing on different aspects of the material each time (e.g., listening to the voice track, looking at the code and diagrams on the slides, etc.). If you have time, you might also want to read the material referenced by the links provided at the bottom of many slides, which are listed on the 2014 POSA MOOC wiki maintained by students

Will there be a Statement of Accomplishment for students who complete this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the quizzes and assignments in this class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.  There will be two levels of Statements of Accomplishment: Normal Track and Distinction Track. The difference between the work performed in each of these tracks is covered at the Coursera website on the POSA MOOC. You needn&#39;t be in the Signature Track to get a Statement of Accomplishment with Distinction, though you do need to be in the Signature Track if you want to be eligible to take the Capstone project course, as described in the next FAQ entry below.

Who is eligible to take the Capstone project course?
For this first offering of the Mobile Cloud Computing with Android (MoCCA) Specialization only students in the Signature Track who receive a &quot;Verified Certificate with Distinction&quot; are eligible to enroll in the Capstone project course. We may remove this restriction in future offerings of the MoCCA Specialization, but our goal in the first offering is to ensure that only students who have demonstrated sufficient mastery of the programming assignments in all three initial MOOCs in the Specialization can take the Capstone project, which will involve a significant amount of programming.

 What is a &quot;trans-institutional MOOC Specialization&quot;?
This MOOC and two other MOOCs (Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems taught by Professor Adam Porter from the University of Maryland and Programming Cloud Services for Android Handheld Systems taught by Jules White from Vanderbilt University) have been designed to complement each other as part of the Coursera Specialization on Mobile Cloud Computing with Android. In particular, the programming assignments and the course project for all the courses will be coordinated. Additional information on our trans-institutional MOOC Specialization is available here.

Is it necessary to take Prof. Adam Porter MOOC prior to the POSA MOOC or can students take the POSA MOOC without taking his course?
If you just want to take some of the courses in this sequence--or take them all in different order--you&#39;re certainly welcome to do so, and you&#39;ll still learn a lot. However, if you take all the courses in this sequence in the order presented you&#39;ll gain a deeper, end-to-end understanding of handheld systems, their applications and services, as well as their integration into the cloud.

When will the course material be made available each week? All the course material (e.g., video lectures, quizzes, programming assignments, etc.), for each week will be made available three days early (i.e., by Fridays) at 9am eastern time (2pm UTC/GMT) so that students can watch and read the material over the weekend prior to the beginning of the next week.
 Is there a required textbook?
There is no required textbook, per se. There&#39;s lots of information available in the videos, slides, and the URLs mentioned in the slides that will help you learn the material we cover in this class. For deeper mastery of the material, however, please see the list of &quot;recommended reading&quot; on the POSA course webpage for a list of books that are closely related to the topics of the course.

Where can students learn about how to configure their Android and Java environment to run the examples and complete the programming assignments?
The POSA MOOC will use the same Eclipse-based Android development environment as Dr. Porter&#39;s earlier MOOC in this Specialization on Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems, Step-by-step instructions on how to setup an Android development environment using Eclipse and Java are available here.  If you&#39;re using a non-Eclipse development environment (such as Intellij IDEA or Android Studio) or want to use a different build tool (such as Maven) you&#39;ll need to enlist the help of other students on the online discussion forum and/or the POSA MOOC Wiki. Mavenized versions of all the programming assignments are available here.

Where can students learn more about patterns and frameworks?
Many videos about patterns and frameworks appeared in the Spring 2013 offering of the POSA MOOC. You can find links to all these videos here, though you may need to register first at this link. The videos in Section 2 and the Appendix have lots of background information on patterns and frameworks. If you&#39;re a Safari online book club member you should check out the Design Patterns in Java video training series that covers the &quot;Gang-of-Four&quot; patterns.
Which web browsers are recommended
Coursera recommends using the Chrome and Firefox browsers. There&#39;s also a mobile app for Coursera MOOC, as well.

Can students use programming language [X] for the course?
The programming assignments in the Android portion of this course are designed for the Java programming language.  The cloud computing portion may provide more flexibility, but it will also focus largely on Java, as well. Although you&#39;re welcome to use other languages on Android for your personal edification, if you stray from Java you&#39;ll have more work to do to map what we&#39;re covering in the videos and projects to the languages you want to use. You may also find it hard to get feedback on your work via the Coursera peer-grading system .

 Where can students download the slides and source code that are presented in the videos and the skeletons that are provided for the programming assignments?
After the 2014 POSA MOOC has officially started in mid-May the PDF versions of the slides will be available for download when the videos are released onto the Coursera POSA MOOC website. These versions of the slides will have clickable links to make it easy to navigate to the supplemental material referenced in the slides.  All the source code examples and skeletons for the programming assignments will be available in this GitHub repository once the Coursera POSA MOOC officially starts. Step-by-step instructions for using GitHub are available here and a video explaining the basics of Git and GitHub is available here.

 How will the 2014 version of the POSA MOOC differ from the 2013 version?
Alhough the 2014 POSA MOOC will cover many of the same patterns (plus new ones), it will be radically different than the 2013 version in almost every other respect. The 2014 POSA MOOC won&#39;t cover some of the more &quot;abstract&quot; topics we discussed in the 2013 POSA MOOC. For example, we won&#39;t have (new) videos on pattern relationships (e.g., pattern sequences, pattern languages, etc.), general discussions of frameworks, design dimensions of concurrency and networking, overview of middleware stacks, etc., since (1) that&#39;s outside the scope of Android and (2) we already have those videos available in the 2013 POSA archives, so you can rewatch the older videos for more information on the themes of object-oriented software patterns, frameworks, and design dimensions. the 2014 POSA MOOC will cover many POSA2 and GoF patterns addressed in Section 3 of the 2013 POSA MOOC, though they&#39;ll be presented in the context of Java and Android instead of C++ and ACE. 

 Where is the material from the 2013 POSA MOOC available online?
All the video lectures, assignments, quizzes, and discussion forum postings from the 2013 offering of the POSA MOOC is available here, though you may need to register first at this link. A summary of the 2013 POSA MOOC is also available here.

 Why does this MOOC&#39;s name start with &quot;Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture?
All MOOCs Douglas C. Schmidt teaches on Coursera have a focus on pattern-oriented software architecture. The details of what sorts of patterns--and what applications of patterns we&#39;ll cover--differ from MOOC-to-MOOC, but the patterns focus is consistent - hence the common prefix for the names.

 What is the schedule for the course lectures, e.g., what times and days will they occur?
This MOOC, like all Coursera MOOCs, uses pre-recorded videos for all the lecture material. As a result, there&#39;s no set time when the class occurs, e.g., you can watch the videos at a time and a pace that is most convenient for you. There will be periodic programming assignments that will have a deadline, which will be clearly marked on the MOOC website. Likewise, there will be weekly quizzes, though their due dates will all be the last day of class so you can take them as time permits. Finally, we&#39;ll have periodic &quot;virtual office hours,&quot; where I&#39;ll answer questions from students and lead impromptu discussions with students live via Google Hangout and YouTube. All these virtual office hours will also be recorded and uploaded to the Coursera website so you can watch them at your convenience.

 What are the plans for offering the MoCCA Specialization again in the future?
We don&#39;t have any definitive plans to re-offer the MoCCA Specialization yet, but we hope to be able to do it again in spring of 2015. The decision depends largely on whether we can convince our universities to continue to allow us to teach these MOOCs, which are very time consuming to create/deliver and aren&#39;t part of our official duties as faculty members. Once the 2014 MoCCA Specialization is finished we&#39;ll decide the future plans and will post an announcement then.

 How long will the course material be available online after the MOOC ends?         
We plan to keep the videos, presentations, discussion forum postings and responses, etc. available indefinitely.

 Where is the source code that corresponds to the pathnames embedded in the slides shown in the videos?
All the Android source code referenced by the pathnames in the slides shown in the videos is available from here (likewise, just the relevant parts of the Android 4.0 code that we&#39;ll be using are available from https://class.coursera.org/posa-002/wiki/Source_Code_By_Week). If you download this source code to your computer the pathnames will be relative to the top-level source directory and typically start with the bionic, dalvik, frameworks, libcore, or packages pathname prefixes. The source code shown for more examples is based on Android 4.0, which is the so-called &quot;Ice Cream Sandwich&quot; release. The code we examine, however, should be largely the same in later versions of Android, as well.

Will there be much flexibility in the schedule of deadlines for programming assignments in the POSA MOOC?
It will be hard to add flexibility into the schedule since this causes chaos with the peer grading system and greatly increases the load on the course staff. The &quot;course staff&quot; is very small (just Doug Schmidt and Jules White), so we&#39;re unlikely to have enough spare time to keep track of flexible deadlines. Students who unable to do all the assignments in the allotted time frame should consider &quot;auditing&quot; the POSA MOOC for this offering and then take it again if/when it&#39;s offered again in the future. Please see item #25 in the FAQ at http://www.coursera.org/course/posa for more thoughts on if/when these MOOCs may be offered again.

How closely aligned will the programming assignments be between MOOCs in the MoCCA Specialization?
The final project for each MOOC in the MoCCA Specialization will involve adding capabilities to the iRemember app. The instructors for all the MOOCs are working together to ensure the iRemember project is properly aligned, though it won&#39;t be necessary to have completed the previous iRemember project(s) in a given MOOC. Moreover, the other programming assignments in their MOOCs will reflect the focus of their respective MOOCs since (1) the topics are largely different in each MOOC and (2) there&#39;s no requirement that students must take the MOOCs in a particular sequence, so inter-MOOC dependencies will be minimized.

How will the programming assignments be assessed?
Once the POSA MOOC officially begins (in mid-May), the final version of the programming assignments will be released every couple of weeks.  We will use a combination of auto-grading (where it makes sense) and peer assessment (where it makes sense) for most of the assignments. The final project (which will involve adding capabilities to the iRemember app started in Dr. Porter&#39;s MOOC) will likely be entirely peer-graded unless we get volunteers to develop suitable auto-grading regression tests for it.

Will the links in the MOOC lecture videos be made clickable and/or consolidated into a single convenient location? 
Students in the POSA MOOC are crowd-sourcing the links from all the lecture slides and adding them to the POSA wiki, so please contribute to this effort. All the lecture slides will be available in PDF form once the videos have been uploaded to the Coursera POSA MOOC website, so you can also access the links that way.

Where are good sources of tutorials and examples for Java and Android concurrency mechanisms?
Concurrency is not an easy topic to master, so students should leverage multiple sources of learning. Useful tutorials on Java concurrency mechanisms appear at http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency  and http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-util-concurrent. It&#39;s also a good idea to download a copy of the Android source code (all of which is available from source.android.com or just the relevant parts of the Android 4.0 code that we&#39;ll be using are available from https://class.coursera.org/posa-002/wiki/Source_Code_By_Week) and review the many examples referenced in the POSA videos, particularly the code in java.util.concurrent in libcore/luni/src/main/java/java/util/concurrent, since this is an excellent way to see how Java concurrency mechanisms covered in the POSA videos are used in practice. Finally, consider reading the books listed in the &quot;Suggested Readings&quot; Section of the POSA MOOC page.

How can students help improve the form and content of the video lectures?
Please leave your constructive comments and suggestions for improving the content of the video lectures in the discussion forum entitled Suggestions for Improving the Video Lectures. The most useful suggestions are ones that help us improve the technical accuracy and quality of the material, rather than just commenting on the presentation format and style. Although there may not be time to address these comments for this offering of the POSA MOOC, we&#39;ll consider them for future offerings. In addition, these suggestions will help to improve the LiveLessons versions of these lectures that will be created during the summer of 2014. Please see this link for more information about the LiveLessons series, including the first set of videos on Design Patterns with Java.

How can students keep informed about important due dates for assignments? 
Once the 2014 POSA MOOC has officially begun (in mid-May), there will be a calendar of events listing the due dates, etc. Likewise, reminders will be posted periodically to the Announcements page (and thus disseminated via email to all enrolled students). Ultimately, however, students are responsible for keeping track of the deadlines and procedures related to properly submitting the MOOC assignments.  Given the large number of students enrolled in the MOOC, there will be little/no support for individual extensions or special handling of late or improperly submitted solutions to the assignments.

How many hours per week will be required for the POSA MOOC?
There&#39;s no 100% accurate way to estimate how long any given student will require to watch the videos and complete the quizzes and assignments each week since each person has different background, aptitude, motivation, learning style, etc. Moreover, some students are doing the &quot;normal track&quot; and others are doing the &quot;distinction track&quot;. With that caveat in mind, please see this link for rough estimates of how much time may be required, depending on which track a student is doing. Concurrency is not an easy topic to master, however, so if doing the material assigned for the &quot;distinction track&quot; consumes an excessive amount of time please consider switching to the &quot;normal track&quot;,l which requires much less work since there are no programming assignments.

What are some consequences of the &quot;massiveness&quot; of a MOOC?
The massive number of students in the POSA MOOC (50,000+) impacts some aspects of the course that differentiate it from a traditional face-to-face courses, such as the courses the instructors teach at Vanderbilt and the University of Maryland.  In particular:

The POSA MOOC course staff will not be able to provide individual feedback on student assignments, though we will present our solutions to the assignments in the weekly &quot;virtual office hours&quot; (see this paper for more information on virtual office hours). If you run into problems feel free to post your buggy code to the appropriate assignment discussion forum so that other students can provide you tips on fixing your bugs.  Please don&#39;t post working solutions to the discussion forum, however, since that violates the Coursera Code of Conduct.
Some things will inevitably go awry, e.g., peer graders will undoubtedly not follow the rubric correctly, students will forget to add their source code when they submit their solutions, important deadlines will be missed due to unforeseen circumstances, etc.
Due to the massive number of students--coupled with the very limited course staff--it&#39;s unfortunately sometimes the case that the instructors won&#39;t be able to &quot;make it right&quot; in a manner that makes everyone happy. In these situations, our goal is to maximize the opportunity for as many students as possible to gain access to a world-class education. Other considerations (such as consistency, fairness, and accountability) are also relevant, but our first priority is to help empower students with an education that will improve their lives.

How do the CS 282 videos relate to the 2014 POSA MOOC videos?
The ~20 hours videos from the Vanderbilt course CS 282: Systems Programming with Android available on the YouTube playlist at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHbIwoevePE&amp;list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp50tvT8806xllaCbd31DpDy overlap with some of the concurrency-related material presented in the 2014 POSA MOOC. However, these YouTube videos are not a substitute for the 2014 POSA MOOC videos, which will be aligned with the programming assignments and topics covered in the MOOC (and which are also much higher quality and more technically accurate). The CS 282 videos are still a valuable resource to supplement the MOOC videos since they cover some topics, such as the Android Development Environment, Activities, certain local Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanisms, etc., that don&#39;t appear in the 2014 POSA MOOC.

What are &quot;Virtual Office Hours&quot;?
&quot;Virtual Office Hours&quot; provide an opportunity for instructors to interact in real-time with students once a week on questions about material covered in the video lectures, quizzes, and programming assignments. Google Hangout and YouTube (see http://www.youtube.user/vuposa are used as the means to engage with students. Google Handout automatically records the office hour discussions, which are then uploaded to the POSA MOOC website so students can view them offline if they can&#39;t make it to the live events. Likewise, any questions post to the discussion forum on Virtual Office Hours will be answered during the session.

How much of the Android software stack is covered by the MoCCA Specialization??
The MOOCs that comprise the MoCCA Specialization cover a wide range of Android and Cloud Computing middleware and application topics, as summarized in this overview video. However, this Specialization does not (yet) cover the full stack of Android and Cloud Computing software. In particular, the Android Linux kernel, user-level device drivers, native development kit, Dalvik virtual machine, and C/C++-based library and service layers are not covered.in detail. Likewise, certain Android middleware topics (such as local inter-process communication mechanisms, network programming, Bound and Unbound Services, and Content Providers) are only touched upon briefly. Future offering of the MoCCA Specialization will (hopefully) provide more coverage of these topics, as time and resources permit.

What&#39;s the best way to watch the videos to avoid being distracted by the presenter&#39;s style and/or call-outs to embedded URLs?
The particular style for the video lectures was choose to (1) mimic the experience of a face-to-face lecture class and (2) minimize the amount of time spent post-producing the videos. The frequent call-outs to embedded URLs is motivated by the reasons outlined in FAQ item #6 above and to simplify the post-production process (for which we have very limited resources). However, some students find this style distracting during the videos.  The easiest way to resolve the presenter distraction is to simply move the media player window so that only the slides are visible.  Ultimately, better solution will materialize in the LiveLessons version of this material that we&#39;ll create during the summer of 2014, which will be professionally edited by Pearson, so if you&#39;re a Safari online book club member you&#39;ll be able to watch this material without distractions.  More information (and examples of the presentation format) are available at the Design Patterns with Java website..

Can students use public source code repositories to store their solutions to the programming assignments?
Please do not use public source code repositories (e.g., the freely available GitHub accounts) to store your solutions to the programming assignments. Publically available repositories encourage students to copy each others work, which is a violation fo the Coursera code of conduct that does not allow students to share work unless explicitly instructed by course policies.

What are some good techniques, tools, and methods for visualizing, analyzing, and debugging concurrent Java programs.
Debugging concurrent programs is hard due to a variety of accidental and inherent complexities discussed in the Section 1: Module 1 of the video lectures. There are many resources available to help students debug their concurrent programs, some of which are free, some of which aren&#39;t, and some are a mixture of free and non-free.The Thread Scheduling Visualizer (TSV) is a set of tools that provide an easy way to record and visualize thread scheduling. The Fluid project provides a set of Eclipse tools for programmers to analyze, assure, and evolve multi-threaded Java programs. Some tips on debugging multi-threaded program are available here.

Where is the source code for examples and assignment solutions from the Vanderbilt CS 282: Systems Programming for Android and CS 251: Intermediate Software Design courses?
The source code for the Java variant of the CS 251 &quot;expression tree processing application&quot; is available as part of the supplemental material for the Pearson LiveLessons courses on Design Patterns with Java. The ThreadedDownloads application example from Section 1: Module 3 is available in GitHub as part of the 2014 POSA MOOC. Other assignment solutions are not available since they form part of the work expected from Vanderbilt students who take these courses.

How much of a focus on patterns and frameworks will there be in this MOOC?
Patterns and framework provide the foundation for much of the material in this course. There is a short introduction to patterns and frameworks in Section 0 and several modules in Section 1 will focus on POSA and GoF patterns and frameworks applied in Android. Many other videos and other resources related to patterns and frameworks are also available here.</field>

	<field name="course_intro">Practical Ethics
Is abortion wrong? Should we eat animals? What is our responsibility to the world’s poor? This course will encourage you to examine your ethical beliefs on topics relevant to the ancient question posed by Socrates: “How am I to live?”</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
In this course you will be encouraged to think about some of the ethical issues that we all face in our daily lives, and as concerned, global citizens. The course will focus on the following topics: 

Brain death and persistent vegetative state 
When is a person dead? In many countries death is now defined as “brain death,” but is this way of understanding death justified? How we define death is important, because it is connected to critical questions such as: When is organ donation permissible? When is it right to take someone off life support? And how should we treat individuals who are in a persistent vegetative state? 

Abortion and the moral status of embryos and fetus 
Most people would argue that it is always wrong to intentionally take the life of an innocent human being. This belief is often expressed in terms of support for the “sanctity of human life.” Is abortion or embryo research compatible with this idea? Does an embryo have a right to life from the beginning of conception, or is this right something it acquires gradually? When, if ever, is abortion justified? 

Making end of life decisions 
How do you distinguish wrongful killing from acts that are not regarded as wrong? Can it ever be right to end the life of someone who cannot express a view about whether he or she wants to live or die? How should we make life and death decisions for severely ill infants? And can euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide be justified? 

Effective altruism 
We all spend money on items that are not necessities. In other parts of the world, people die for the want of food or medicines that cost a few cents. The common view is that giving to poor people in other countries is charity, something that is good to do, but not wrong if we don’t. But is that really true? This topic concerns what our responsibility is for people less well of than us, what the best cause is, and what good career choices are. How much we ought to do for others? 

Climate change 
On what principles should nations agree on the extent of their emissions of greenhouse gasses? Should the nations that have contributed most to climate change compensate the nations that are suffering, and will suffer, most from it? Or should some other principle of justice govern the way we allocate quotas for greenhouse gas emissions? 

Animals 
It is common to draw a sharp line between how we are allowed to treat human beings and what we are allowed to do to animals. We consider cannibalism abhorrent, but routinely raise and kill animals for food. We set strict guidelines for experimenting on human beings, but much more lax ones for experimenting on animals. Is this attitude to animals justifiable? One way to put this question is to ask: “Do animals have rights?” But the debate does not have to revolve around animal rights. It can also be put in terms of the idea of equality, and where it stops—that is, does equality only apply to human beings? This topic concerns how we should treat animals, and when experimentation on animals is justified. 

Environmental values 
It is one thing to argue that we can extend ethics beyond the boundary of our own species, to other sentient beings, but it is a quite different thing to hold that there is also intrinsic value in something that cannot feel anything, like plants, or isn’t even alive, like mountains and streams. Can such a claim be justified? If it cannot, what difference does it make to the case for wilderness protection? 

Why act ethically? Many of you might reach the conclusion that the ethical life can be a demanding one. So why bother? Why act ethically, rather than doing whatever you please? This is an ancient question, which some philosophers have dismissed as illegitimate, and others have sought to answer, in various ways. It leads us to questions about the meaning of life, and what it is to lead a good life. 

This course will introduce you to some of the ways philosophers have approached these questions, as well as some of their answers. You will also be encouraged to question your own ethical beliefs, and in the process explore the extent to which reason and argument can play a role in everyday ethical decision-making.

Themes covered include global health, workforce management, cultural dynamics, geopolitical implications, and health promotion.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This course gives a broad overview of the maternal and newborn health issues facing developing countries, where more than 2.6 million babies are stillborn and nearly 500,000 women die during childbirth or from pregnancy complications each year. In the developing world, many women deliver at home without the support of skilled health providers and modern technology. Maternal and newborn survival can be improved by health systems strengthening emergency obstetric and newborn care while optimizing the health workforce to increase access to basic maternal and newborn health care services through task-shifting.

Through lectures, case studies, and readings, course participants will learn about maternal and newborn health delivery challenges across the world and how to utilize community-based strategies to improve survival rates for mothers and babies.

Course Syllabus
Week One: Introduction to Maternal Mortality and Morbidity in the Global Context

Child mortality has decreased rapidly in recent decades, while maternal mortality has declined at a much slower pace; in some places, little improvement has been made at all. In this module, we’ll explore the scope of the maternal health crisis, the timing and major physiological causes of death and disability the inequalities and inequities between and within countries.

Week Two: Introduction to Maternal Mortality and Morbidity in the US Context

While maternal in the United States is relatively low compared with that in the developing countries, it is much higher than it should be. In this module, we’ll explore the scope of the maternal mortality and morbidity in the United States, the inequalities and inequities between and within subpopulations of the country.

Week Three: The Impact of the Health Care Workforce Shortage on Maternal and Newborn Care

The global health care workforce shortage is leading to understaffed hospitals and shuttered health clinics across the world. Because of this dangerous shortage, patients are left without the critical care they need for survival. This shortage is exceptionally acute in developing countries such as Sub-Saharan Africa, which carries nearly 25% of the world’s disease burden but only 3% of the world’s health care workforce. This module will cover strategies to alleviate the shortage and maldistribution of the health care workforce in developing countries—particularly among nurses, midwives, and other skilled providers of maternal and newborn care.

Week Four: Emergency Obstetric Care: Health Facility Services that Support Maternal and Newborn Care

In conjunction with increasing the global maternal health workforce, health systems must be strengthened to enable the provision of life-saving interventions that cannot be delivered at the community level. The primary means of achieving this goal is through the implementation of emergency obstetric care (EmOC) in health facilities. The main objectives of this lecture are to: review the rationale for EmOC, identify its “signal functions,” understand the United Nations process indicators for monitoring EmOC, describe monitoring and quality improvement approaches, and recognize key challenges to effective implementation of EmOC in developing country contexts.

Week Five: Improving Maternal and Newborn Care through Community-Based Interventions

 Community mobilization is a promising strategy for improving access to/use of maternal and newborn health services. This module provides an understanding of how delivery of maternal and newborn care might be improved through community-based interventions that effectively include and engage the community in identifying and implementing sustainable solutions. 

Week Six: Case Study in Ethiopia: Educating the Community and Training Front-Line Community Health Workers to Deliver Maternal and Newborn Care

In Ethiopia about 90% of births occur at home, and an estimated 22,000 women and 100,000 newborns die annually from childbirth-related complications. This module describes a project that uses an innovative community-based strategy to ensure that more women and newborns in this country receive effective and timely care. The Maternal and Newborn Health in Ethiopia Partnership (MaNHEP) educates pregnant women and families on safe birth and postnatal care practices, and trains frontline health workers to deliver a basic package of life-saving maternal and newborn care that can significantly improve health and survival (including referral to higher levels of the health care system).</field>

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This course introduces the basic mathematical and programming principles that underlie much of Computer Science. Understanding these principles is crucial to the process of creating efficient and well-structured solutions for computational problems.

To get hands-on experience working with these concepts, we will use the Python programming language. The main focus of the class will be weekly mini-projects that build upon the mathematical and programming principles that are taught in the class. To keep the class fun and engaging, many of the projects will involve working with strategy-based games.

After completing this course, you will have a much stronger background in Computer Science and be capable of writing Python programs that are both efficient and well-structured. You will also have a better understanding of how to approach more complex computational problems. As always, our goal is to teach these principles of computing in a fun and exciting way. We look forward to seeing you in class!
Course Syllabus
Our course syllabus can be seen at www.codeskulptor.org/coursera/principlescomputing.html.

Investigate the basic concepts behind programming languages, with a strong emphasis on the techniques and benefits of functional programming. Use the programming languages ML, Racket, and Ruby in ways that will teach you how the pieces of a language fit together to create more than the sum of the parts. Gain new software skills and the concepts needed to learn new languages on your own.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Learn many of the concepts that underlie all programming languages. Develop a programming style known as functional programming and contrast it with object-oriented programming. Through experience writing programs and studying three different languages, learn the key issues in designing and using programming languages, such as modularity and the complementary benefits of static and dynamic typing. This course is neither particularly theoretical nor just about programming specifics – it will give you a framework for understanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to design correct and elegant programs. By using different languages, you learn to think more deeply than in terms of the particular syntax of one language. The emphasis on functional programming is essential for learning how to write robust, reusable, composable, and elegant programs – in any language.
Course Syllabus
Note: About half the students in prior offerings report an estimated workload of 8-12 hours / week is accurate while most of the other half spent more time -- 15 hours / week or more. Workload naturally differs for different people depending on one&#39;s background. Do see the recommended-background section below.

Topics (most of which may not mean anything to you until you take the course):

Syntax vs. semantics vs. idioms vs. libraries vs. tools
ML basics (bindings, conditionals, records, functions)
Recursive functions and recursive types
Benefits of no mutation
Algebraic datatypes, pattern matching
Tail recursion
First-class functions and function closures
Lexical scope
Currying
Syntactic sugar
Equivalence and effects
Parametric polymorphism and container types
Type inference
Abstract types and modules
Racket basics
Dynamic vs. static typing
Laziness, streams, and memoization
Implementing languages, especially higher-order functions
Macros
Eval
Ruby basics
Object-oriented programming is dynamic dispatch
Pure object-orientation
Implementing dynamic dispatch
Multiple inheritance, interfaces, and mixins
OOP vs. functional decomposition and extensibility
Subtyping for records, functions, and objects
Subtyping
Class-based subtyping
Subtyping vs. parametric polymorphism; bounded polymorphism
Recommended Background
The course assumes students are familiar with programming covered by most introductory courses -- this is not an introductory programming course.  Conversely, it is also not a particularly advanced course -- a couple good prior programming courses should be enough.  Students should be comfortable with variables, conditionals, arrays, linked lists, stacks, and recursion (though recursion will be reviewed and expanded upon), and the difference between an interface and an implementation. Students should be eager to write programs in languages new to them.  Later parts of the course analyze basic object-oriented concepts and contrast them with those of other languages, so familiarity with Java or a closely related language (e.g., C#) is helpful, but not required for homework assignments.
Suggested Readings
Course videos and programming exercises serve as the bulk of class content. Written notes by the instructor are also available and serve as a valuable resource.
Course Format
Video segments have short question-and-answer sections, but the main work will be seven homework assignments that involve writing small programs. The programming assignments will be automatically graded and students will peer-assess each other&#39;s submissions for style. Critiquing other’s work and receiving comments about your own are invaluable learning experiences. The course also has a midterm exam and a final exam.</field>

	<field name="course_intro">Introduction to Systematic Program Design - Part 1
This course is about learning to program well: building programs that are elegant, well tested and easy to maintain. The course is designed for students with no programming experience at all. Nonetheless, former students who already knew how to program have said it made them better programmers.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Phones, diesel engines, animated newspapers, medical devices, games, political campaigns, medical research, mining, transportation systems, ... and so on, and on, and on... every day more of the world around us is at least partly run by computer programs. This means that being able to design programs - or at least be able to work with people who design programs - is becoming a more and more valuable skill.

To build your own programs you need to know two things: how to use the specific programming language and libraries needed, and the more general skill of how to design a program.

This course presents a design method that will enable you to approach the design of complex programs systematically. The method will work for programs in this course as well as hard to design programs you develop in the future.

Using this method you will learn how to model the information in a problem domain, how to structure program data to mirror that information and how to further structure the data to lead to a well organized program. You will also learn to distinguish those parts of a program that are naturally data driven, from those that should use an alternative algorithmic approach. The method uses unit-tests to both produce a better developed design, and to test your program as you develop it.

In the first course -- Part 1 -- we use a simple teaching language to cover the core of the design method. In Part 1 we cover various forms of data; simple interactive programs like games and animations; storing information in and rendering trees; and finally exploring search programs: programs that solve puzzles like Sudoku boards. 

A second phase of the course, to be offered later,  will consist of parallel tracks, with each track using a different popular programming language and focusing on a different kind of problem. This will help you bring the design method to whatever language and problem domain interests you.

Course Syllabus
Week One: Introduction and the structure of the course. The Beginning Student Language; expressions and evaluation rules; primitive operations on numbers, strings and images. The How to Design Functions (HtDF) Recipe.

Week Two: Representing information as data. The How to Design Data (HtDD) recipe. Atomic forms of data including intervals, enumerations, and itemizations.

Week Three: The design of simple interactive programs. The big-bang user interface framework. The How to Design Worlds (HtDW) recipe. Representing information where two or more values naturally form a whole using compound data.

Week Four: Representing arbitrary sized information using lists. Decomposition of information into multiple types.

Week Five: Functions operating on natural numbers. A parlor trick. Rules for decomposing functions.

Week Six: List abbreviations. Mutual reference allows more complex arbitrary-sized data. Using binary trees to enable fast lookup of information. Using arbitrary arity trees to represent inherently hierarchical information.

Week Seven: Functions that consume two arguments that have &#39;one-of&#39; in their types. Using local definitions to improve the structure of programs.

Week Eight: Using abstraction to control reduce repetition and complexity in programs.

Week Nine: Generative recursion, fractals and search problems.

Recommended Background
No prior programming experience is assumed, and only a grade school math background is required.
Suggested Readings
A detailed description of the design method, as well as weekly lecture notes will be available online. No textbook is required, but the second edition of How to Design Programs, by Felleisen, Findler, Flatt and Krishnamurthi is valuable supplementary reading; the book is available online at no cost.
Course Format
The course will include weekly video lecture material as well as assigned design problems. There will also be two small projects and a final exam. Because programs must be written to be read by others the two projects will be peer graded. This will give students experience with reading code written by peers and having their code evaluated by peers.
FAQ
Can students ask questions? 
We will use an on-line discussion group to enable students to ask and answer questions. Course staff will monitor the group to ensure accuracy of student answers as well as to handle unanswered questions.

What programming languages will the course use?

This course -- Part 1 of a 2 course sequence -- uses a teaching language called Beginning Student Language. Part 2 will be broken into parallel tracks that tackle problems in different domains using one or more popular languages such as Python and Javascript.

What resources will I need for this class?

For this course all you need is an internet connection and a computer. The software we will use is available for free download, and the supplementary text is also available online for free.</field>

Behind every mouse click and touch-screen tap, there is a computer program that makes things happen. This course introduces the fundamental building blocks of programming and teaches you how to write fun and useful programs using the Python language.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
A computer program is a set of instructions for a computer to follow, just as a recipe is a set of instructions for a chef. Laptops, kitchen appliances, MP3 players, and many other electronic devices all run computer programs. Programs have been written to manipulate sound and video, write poetry, run banking systems, predict the weather, and analyze athletic performance. This course is intended for people who have never seen a computer program. It will give you a better understanding of how computer applications work and teach you how to write your own applications. More importantly, you’ll start to learn computational thinking, which is a fundamental approach to solving real-world problems. Computer programming languages share common fundamental concepts, and this course will introduce you to those concepts using the Python programming language. By the end of this course, you will be able to write your own programs to process data from the web and create interactive text-based games.
Recommended Background
This course is intended for people who have never programmed before.  A knowledge of grade school mathematics is necessary: you need to be comfortable with simple mathematical equations, including operator precedence. You should also be comfortable working with simple functions, such as f(x) = x + 5.

Suggested Readings
This online course is intended to be self-contained, but if you want additional reading material you will find that Practical Programming (2nd edition): An Introduction to Computer Science Using Python 3 matches the course material closely.
Course Format
The class consists of 1 to 2 hours of lecture each week, which are made up of videos that are generally shorter than 10 minutes each. Each video contains integrated quiz questions. There are also weekly standalone exercises that are not part of the video lectures and a (non-optional) final exam.

FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.

Can I really do this course if I don’t know anything about programming?
Yes! We expect this course to be taken by people completely new to programming.

What resources will I need for this class?
We use the freely-available Python 3 and the IDLE development environment (which comes with Python 3). The download is available here: http://www.python.org/download/. Download the most recent release of Python 3.

What is the coolest thing I&#39;ll learn if I take this class?
You will be able to develop interactive text-based programs such as a word search game.</field>

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Most programs are used for years and are worked on by many people. Having programs that are easy to understand is essential, in the same way that a well-organized essay is far easier to follow than a disorganized one. We’ll show you an approach that helps to break down problems into smaller tasks that are easier to both solve and read.
 
This design approach also makes it more straightforward to find and fix flaws. You&#39;ll be introduced to the tools that professional programmers use; they&#39;re called &quot;testing&quot; and &quot;debugging&quot;.
 
For most complex problems, there are many programs that solve them. Some are inherently slower than others. You&#39;ll learn how to read two programs and compare them for efficiency.
Recommended Background

Learn about how psychology has developed a body of knowledge about behavior and mind through the use of scientific methods. All areas of psychology will be covered.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Since we were young children, we have tried to understand, to predict, and to control behavior. We first dealt with our parents and teachers, and later our friends and companions. This course shows, however, how the understanding, prediction, and control of behavior require scientific validation. By using tools that are systematic and objective, psychology has learned how people behave and think. 

Psychology is a very broad field of study and the course will include discussions of the brain and nervous system, sensation and perception, learning, memory, intelligence and thinking, lifespan development, emotion and motivation, personality, social behavior, behavioral disorders, and psychological treatment of disorders. The course will include short lecture modules, demonstrations and experiments, and writing assignments. 

Course Syllabus
This is a twelve-week Introductory Psychology course that is usually taught in the first year of college. There is a Spring Break during the week of March 17-21, 2014. Psychology is a broad discipline as you can see in the outline, and the course will survey the many areas studied by psychologists. Psychologists study the mind and behavior.

This course was funded by a generous grant from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. The QM certification mark recognizes that this course met Quality Matters review standards.
Prerequisite Knowledge
There are no prerequisites for this course.
Online Resources
We will be using material developed by Carnegie Mellon University called the Open Learning Initiative. The OLI material is divided into 56 modules and the course outline indicates which modules will be covered each week. Learning objectives are given at the beginning of each module.
Grading Policy
There will be a multiple choice quiz at the end of each week of lecture (11 quizzes total). The quizzes will be timed and you can only take each quiz only once. Quizzes will be available from 5:00 PM EST on Friday of each week until 5:00 PM on the next Wednesday. The lowest quiz score will be automatically dropped. There will be a final exam at the end of the course. The overall allocation of quizzes and projects to the final grade are as follows::
Quiz average: 50% of final grade
Final examination: 50% of final grade
A total score of 70% or higher will guarantee a passing grade in the course and a Statement of Accomplishment. Earning a score of 85% or higher will guarantee a passing grade in the course and a Statement of Accomplishment with Distinction.
Communication
Please communicate with the instructor and staff via the online forums. Because there are so many students, it is not possible for us to respond individually to every question. There will be a Q&amp;A forum where you can post your questions about the course. Students will have the opportunity to &quot;vote up&quot; questions they want answered, and the questions with the most votes will be answered either in a forum post or a video. Announcements from the instructor about the course will be sent via e-mail to all registered students and also will appear on the announcement page.
Netiquette
Written English language will be the primary means of communication. Please interact with your fellow students and the instructor in the discussion forums. There can be miscommunication as there is no intonation in these written communications. Please be positive, supportive, and constructive in your comments and forum postings.
Expectations
Participants are expected to:
Watch all lecture videos every week
Complete all quizzes and the final examination
Abide by the standards of academic honesty – plagiarism and any form of cheating will not be tolerated and will result in the removal of the participant from the course
Seek help if needed from your fellow students by using the forums
Honesty
Your answers on quizzes and the exam should be your own.
Course Goals
Upon successful completion of the course, students will be able to describe what psychologists study. They will be exposed to basic information about the different areas of psychology listed as different modules in OLI and weekly topics in the outline. They will understand that we can understand behavior only by doing research to uncover the facts. 

Specific course goals are:
Students will be able to recognize and describe major psychological principles, theories, and perspectives.
Students will be able to distinguish between different methods used by psychologists to study the different areas of psychology.
Students will be able to describe the nature-nurture controversy across different areas of psychology.
Students will know the basic principles in each area of psychology and how good research is required to understand these principles.
For each area of psychology, students will know how the nervous system and other biological systems are involved in understanding behavior in that area.

	<field name="course_intro">Buddhism and Modern Psychology
The Buddha said that human suffering—ranging from anxiety to sadness to unfulfilled craving—results from not seeing reality clearly. He described a kind of meditation that promises to ease suffering by dispelling illusions about the world and ourselves. What does psychological science say about this diagnosis and prescription—and about the underlying model of the mind?</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
The Dalai Lama has said that Buddhism and science are deeply compatible and has encouraged Western scholars to critically examine both the meditative practice and Buddhist ideas about the human mind. A number of scientists and philosophers have taken up this challenge. There have been brain scans of meditators and philosophical examinations of Buddhist doctrines. There have even been discussions of Darwin and the Buddha: Do early Buddhist descriptions of the mind, and of the human condition, make particular sense in light of evolutionary psychology? 

This course will examine how Buddhism is faring under this scrutiny. Are neuroscientists starting to understand how meditation “works”? Would such an understanding validate meditation—or might physical explanations of meditation undermine the spiritual significance attributed to it? And how are some of the basic Buddhist claims about the human mind holding up? We’ll pay special attention to some highly counterintuitive doctrines: that the self doesn’t exist, and that much of perceived reality is in some sense illusory. Do these claims, radical as they sound, make a certain kind of sense in light of modern psychology? And what are the implications of all this for how we should live our lives? Can meditation make us not just happier, but better people?

Course Syllabus
Week 1: The Buddhist Diagnosis
Week 2: The Buddhist Prescription
Week 3: Does Your Self Exist?
Week 4: A New Model of the Mind
Week 5: Meditation, Modules, and Evolutionary Psychology
Week 6: What Is Enlightenment?





Recommended Background
No background in psychology or religious studies is assumed on the part of students. But it will help to have a curiosity about how the mind works, an interest in what accounts for the ups and downs of human experience, and an interest in the meaning of life.

Suggested Readings
Suggested readings will include Buddhist scriptures, scientific papers, philosophical writings, and excerpts from books (including my book The Moral Animal). Many suggested readings will be provided online, and none of suggested readings is essential to understanding the lectures. 

Course Format
There will be a one-hour lecture each week, and each lecture will be broken up into modules that are between 8 and 25 minutes in length. After each module there will be several multiple choice questions—not for purposes of evaluating you, but just to help you decide whether you should go back and review the previous module before moving on. There will be two short essays, one after the third lecture and one after the final lecture. Students are also encouraged to participate in the online forum--which, in addition to enriching the learning experience, can be a lot of fun.

FAQ

This course deals with the economic role of the state and explores factors that affect government performance. Both normative economic theories of the state and positive analyses of government’s involvement in the private sector will be presented.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
In this course I will cover main features and dilemmas of government’s role and presence in the private sector and the society. Unlike conventional public economic courses that concentrate on taxation and public expenditures, I will offer a modern multidisciplinary perspective of government as an economic agent.

The course will summarize a vast body of empirical evidence from around the world as to what factors make governments more or less efficient.

Of primary interest will be the agency relations between government and society, i.e. ways and means to ensure government accountability and prevention of the abuse of power. Accordingly we will discuss the impact of constitutions and political regimes on government performance. The course will also deal with how the size of government and state capacity affect development, and how those evolve over time.

We will discuss proper scope of government – what programs and services the state should administer itself, and which of those should better be outsourced to private firms – perhaps in the private-public partnership format.

An important theme of the course will be the choice of appropriate tools for government intervention, and in particular - the tradeoff between public regulation, by  resolving disputes by courts, and by opting for self-regulation and other private sector mechanisms. 

We will discuss government pathologies, most and foremost corruption and ways and means to keep it under control. The dual role of civil society as an alternative to government and factor of government accountability will be explored. 

Course Syllabus
Week one

State as an economic agent

 

Week two

Factors of state’s effectiveness and quality of governance

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Principles of Public Health introduces the major concepts of public health and the determinants of health status in communities. The course emphasizes the ecological model that focuses on the linkages and relationships among multiple natural and social determinants affecting health. As a relative concept, the health of populations is assessed through comparisons of temporal, spatial, and demographic dimensions of disease burden. The goal of public health is to understand why and how different populations carry different kinds and amounts of disease burden, and to use that knowledge for improving health by preventing disease. 

Students in the course will explore successful examples in public health, including how scientific discoveries and regulatory policies have both contributed to mitigate risk factors and improve health outcomes. How socioeconomic and cultural factors modify the effectiveness of risk intervention and disease prevention strategies. How individual actions and collective initiatives play important roles in determining the status of health. In addition, how the various methodological approaches that guide discoveries in public health have been applied from the local scale to the global level.

Course Syllabus
Week One: What is Public Health?

A report from the National Association of Colleges and Employers shows that employers want job candidates with strong communication skills. Similarly, educational success also requires the ability to articulate your thoughts clearly. In this class, we will study the principles of public speaking; critically examine our own and others’ speeches through interactive practice.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
The overriding goal of this course is to demystify the process of writing, practicing, and performing a clear and engaging speech. In so doing, I hope this course can help each student improve the quality of their speeches and confidence with which they present them.
More specifically, upon successfully completing this course, you should be able to:

design and deliver basic presentations concisely;
design and deliver informative presentations clearly;
design and deliver complex arguments persuasively;
speak confidently with appropriate rate, projection, movement, and vocal variety; 
evaluate and critique speeches insightfully.

Week 5: Preparing informative speeches
Week 6: Delivering informative speeches
Week 7: Persuasive speech basics
Week 8: Preparing persuasive speeches
Week 9: Delivering persuasive speeches
Week 10: Course Conclusion

Recommended Background
If you wish to complete the three speech assignments, you must have access to video recording equipment (e.g., digital camera, cell phone, flip camera, webcam, or video camera) and the ability to share this digital content via YouTube, Vimeo, or Aparat.
Since there is no certificate, the uploading of speeches is entirely optional. Students who choose to not post video will not be denied any access to the course content.


Course Format
In designing this course, I wanted to provide a wide range of activities and assignments for the wide range of student interest and needs. Some students may want only to watch the video lectures and take the quizzes; others may invest more fully and post sample videos and participate actively in discussion forums. Here are some of the course assignments and activities:

Video lectures: Most of the course content is delivered through a number of video lectures. Each video runs 8-12 minutes and teaches a specific public speaking ability or concept.
Discussion forums: This class thrives on discussion. There are a number of discussion forums that emerge from the lectures and sample speeches. You will have the ability to articulate your views on public speaking as well as learn from your peers.
Quizzes: Many video lectures have short quizzes embedded that reinforce basic knowledge of certain concepts and argument structures.
Speech Analysis and Modeling: One of the best ways to refine your own speech ability is through a close study of others&#39; speeches. We will have a number of opportunities to examine and discuss sample speeches and speakers.
Peer Assessment Assignments: There are four optional speech assignments: an impromptu, informative, and persuasive speech. Students can elect to record and post videos of their speeches.
FAQ
How long will the course take to complete?
The course will require approximately 3-5 hours of your time per week in total effort.

Is there a statement of completion or certificate issued for this course?

No, there is no statement of completion or credential any type awarded for this course. 

Can I stop the lecture stream and/or the assessment quizzes without losing work?

The lectures are essentially like YouTube videos, so if you stop it mid-stream, you can just start it again. For the quizzes, there is a &quot;Save Answers&quot; button at the bottom of each quiz that will allow you to carry over answers from session to session.

Can I access the course and contents after it ends?

All quizzes and homework assignments need to be completed by the listed due dates. After this date, currently enrolled students can continue to access this course session via a “View class archive” button on the Coursera landing page for the course. As this course may be run in the future, students may choose to enroll in and attend a new session of the course if they wish.

Recommended Background
No background is required; all are welcome --- well, unless one is allergic to even basic maths
Course Format
Each class consists of 4-6 lecture videos, which are approximately 10 minutes long. These usually contain one quiz per video, that are only meant to check the student&#39;s progress and have nothing to do with certification.

At the end of each video, a few links are given to webpages (often Wikipedia entries). These are meant for the student to start browsing somewhere: they are not meant to be exhaustive, and even less to define the &quot;ultimate truth&quot; --- sure enough, to the best of my knowledge, the information is at least honest and trustworthy. At times, some books are also suggested, in the same spirit. None of this material is compulsory reading.

There is no homework.

Certification: two MCQ tests, one at the end of lecture 4 (40 questions at 1 point each, bearing on lectures 1-4) and one at the end of the course (10 questions at 3 point each bearing on the main messages of the course, and 30 questions at 1 point each bearing on lectures 5-8). The passing grade is 50 points, a statement of accomplishment is given for 85 points and above.</field>

You have one liver but three patients awaiting a liver transplant. Who should get the liver? What criteria should be used to select the recipient? Is it fair to give it to an alcoholic? These are some of the questions that arise in the context of rationing and allocating scarce health care resources among particular individuals, and concern what are called micro-allocation decisions. But trade-offs also need to be made at the meso- and macro-level. Budgets of public payers of healthcare, such as governments, and of private ones, such as health plans, are limited: they cannot cover all drugs and services that appear beneficial to patients or physicians. So what services should they provide? Is there a core set of benefits that everyone should be entitled to? How can we make fair decisions, if we know from the outset than not all needs can be met? Using the cases of organs for transplantation, the rationing for vaccines in a flu pandemic, and drug shortages, the course will critically examine alternative theories for allocating scarce resources among individuals, while also exploring the principles and values that underlie those theories.

Course Syllabus
Logistics and Grading
This class is seven weeks long. Each week, students will watch approximate 30 - 40 minutes of lectures by Dr. Emanuel. Students should expect to spend 2 - 5 hours per week reading related materials from the reading list, all of which are freely accessible online.

Students taking the course for a grade will complete one quiz (also referred to throughout the course as a peer assessment) per week, which will be peer-graded based on a detailed answer key provided after the due date. Of the seven scores earned for assignments, the lowest two scores will be dropped in calculating the final grade. The remaining five scores will be weighted equally. As a result, students who miss a homework assignment can still earn full credit in the course. There are no exams or final projects in this course. Students not taking the course for a grade may choose not to complete the assignments.

The details of these logistics are subject to change; if changes are made, students will be notified via an announcement and this page will be updated.


Course Outline 

Week 1: &quot;Who Gets the Liver?&quot; &amp; History of Rationing
We begin the course with a hypothetical case. We have one liver and three patients who will die if they don&#39;t get a transplant. We will discuss some of the potential approaches for making life and death decisions in the context of absolute scarcity. Next we will explore the history of rationing in medicine. Absolute scarcity has always been a problem. How have we dealt with this problem in the past? We&#39;ll take a look at what happened in the cases of three major 20th century medial advances: insulin, penicillin, and dialysis.

Week 2: Conceptual Distinctions
The study of rationing was borne out of the concept of absolute scarcity in medicine--cases in which the demand for medical care far exceeds the resources existing to meet that need. Because demand will inevitably exceed supply--no matter what--choices must be made about which patients receive treatment, and which don&#39;t. But what do we really mean when we use the term &#39;rationing?&#39; Is there a difference between the terms rationing, resource allocation, and priority-setting? In this lecture, we will attempt to explain the conceptual distinctions that give meaning to the terms we use in this course.

Week 3: Organs for Transplantation
Kidneys, livers, hearts, and lungs are among the most discussed absolutely scarce medical resources. And their allocation poses some of the most vexing ethical dilemmas. The lecture for this week will break down the process by which organs for transplantation are allocated in the United States through the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). We will discuss some of the values and principles that are implicitly favored in the UNOS rules and grapple with a few particularly difficult cases. Should alcoholics with cirrhosis be eligible to receive a liver transplant, if their receiving a liver means a person with a &quot;blameless&quot; liver disease will die as a result? What role should socioeconomic or legal status play in organ transplantation? Do you agree with the UNOS policies as written?

Week 4: Theories
This week, we will explore some of the moral schools of thought that have shaped the modern-day study of bioethics, and have a tremendous impact on health policy. Deontology regards morality as the driving guide behind our choices of what we ought to do. Utilitarianism, on the other hand, views the proper course of action as the one that maximizes utility. The tension between these two ethical theories highlights the ethical dilemmas that bioethicists face in determining how to ration scarce medical resources.

Week 5: Values &amp; Principles
Value judgments are inescapable in rationing decisions. But what are the competing values and principles that are inherently at play? How can one choose among them? This week&#39;s lecture explores 4 key values and 8 guiding principles that ethicists and policymakers must consider when confronting rationing decisions. We&#39;ll look at the distinctions between the values and principles, and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each. Additionally, we&#39;ll examine the Complete Lives System, which is a theoretical framework designed to draw upon multiple principles and values.

Week 6: Flu Emergency
This week, we will explore another real life example of rationing in action. What should we do if there is a major flu pandemic and there isn&#39;t enough vaccine to go around? Who should get the limited vaccine and who should not? We&#39;ll examine the U.S. Government&#39;s actual policy for major health crises. For example, we will look at Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) briefs that deal with allocation protocols in the event of an influenza pandemic. We will also look into historical examples of flu crises, and analyze the ethical approaches taken in specific case studies.

Week 7: From Micro to Macro
For the final week of the course, we&#39;ll examine the difference between micro rationing decisions and meso/macro decisions. We&#39;ll look at the case of Shep Glazer, whose testimony before Congress fundamentally changed the way dialysis treatment was allocated in the United States. We&#39;ll also look briefly at cost effectiveness analysis and the Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) as tools for macro level decisions. What paradoxes arise when using these tools? Do they favor some people over others? What values are implicit in policies that draw upon cost-effectiveness and QALYs?

In this course we will study Plato&#39;s ancient art of blowing up your beliefs as you go, to make sure they&#39;re built to last. We spend six weeks studying three Platonic dialogues, then two more weeks pondering a pair of footnotes to Plato; that is, we will consider some contemporary manifestations of issues Plato discusses. The more things change, the more they stay the same.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
&quot;The safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato.”

– A. N. Whitehead

Elsewhere Whitehead points out how Plato pulled it off: by writing all the ‘heresies’ in advance. That is, whenever anyone says Plato was wrong—and how, and why—it turns out Plato himself said it first. (As P.T. Barnum said—but maybe Plato proved it first?—there’s no such thing as bad publicity. And the cover-up is usually worse than the crime. That&#39;s as true in philosophy as in US politics)

In this course, students study Plato’s ancient art of blowing up your beliefs as you go, to make sure they’re built to last. We spend six weeks reading three Platonic dialogues (a bit like plays, in which we see two sides of an argument come to life.) Then, for two more weeks, we study a pair of footnotes. That is, we will consider some contemporary manifestations of issues Plato discusses. Our focus will be: moral theory and moral psychology. 

It turns out: the more you blow up your beliefs, the more they stay the same (as I mentioned already).

Why ‘Reason and Persuasion’? The title is generic, and indicates that the course will be - if this is what you are looking for - a general, introduction to philosophy, as it tends to be taught at the university level. But the title also points to a specific problem: reason without persuasion is useless; persuasion without reason is dangerous. Plato worried about it. So will we.

The course will be of interest to a wide variety of students. There are a variety of reasons why you might want to know at least a little about what Plato thought and wrote. I will do my best to teach in a way that accommodates as wide a range of likely interests in the subject as i can manage.




Course Syllabus
WEEK 1 – Introductions all around: to the course; to philosophy as subject; to Plato and Socrates; to the dialogue form; to Plato’s Euthyphro. Who are these people. Why are they interesting? 

WEEK 2 - Plato&#39;s Euthyphro: two problems - one practical, one definitional. 1) Euthyphro thinks his dad is a murderer (or near enough). What should you do if someone close to you did the wrong thing? Should you call them on it, or let it slide for the sake of the relationship? 2) what is holiness. (What is the definition of &#39;holiness&#39;?) This leads to two more problems. 3) What does problem 1 have to do with problem 2? Last but not least: since none of problems 1-3 has a clear answer, 4) is there some less unhelpful way we can think about the whole mess? Some notes about the ancient Athenian justice system. What would have happened if Euthyphro&#39;s case actually came to trial? Could we maybe design a system that would work better? To what extent would that fix the problem? Also, what good is it talking to Euthyphro if he isn&#39;t the sort of person who&#39;s ever going to listen? (Especially if you humiliate him like that.) 

WEEK 3 – Plato’s Meno: but first, some last reflections on Euthyphro, with incidental notes about Greek tragedy. What&#39;s our best guess about what Plato is getting at, in a positive sense, writing this dialogue that seems to go nowhere? Then, Meno. We meet new characters and a new problem: what is virtue? That question sounds funny in English - a bit old-fashioned. But Meno means something down-to-earth and not the least bit old-fashioned (then or now): what does it take to be a success? To be excellent! Top of the heap! But soon enough Socrates has transmuted Meno&#39;s aspirations into something strange, by means of repeated requests for a definition. Meno, like Euthyphro, is bad at this game. We conclude with some basic typology of ethical theories, trying to figure out where we stand. 

WEEK 4 - Plato&#39;s Meno: Virtue - Geometry - Virtue. This dialogue has a counter-intuitive structure. There&#39;s a chunk of math between two slices of virtue. Not to worry, reader! Meno finds the combination as off-putting as you do. The key turns out to be this: we need to understand the nature of the mind; its basic relationship to the world. How are you going to understand how people succeed if you don&#39;t get how they learn? But there the commonsense ends. Plato has a bold but strange model of the mind. And an even stranger sense of the relationship between ethics and mathematics. (I hope you are provoked to say why you are so sure it must be wrong.) We end on a practical note: Meno is a sophist who is sure 1) that he knows it all; 2) that nothing can really be known. This makes him very hard to teach. It&#39;s good to notice this about people. 

WEEK 5 - Plato&#39;s Republic, Book I: The Father and the Son. Our question now is: what is justice? This time Socrates faces a series of three interlocutors (debating partners). The first two are easy: the father-son tag-team, Cephalus and Polemarchus. But the Boss Fight - against Thrasymachus - is hard. So people focus on that. But Cephalus - nice old retired businessman - and his honor-loving, earnest son are interesting. They aren&#39;t clever at debate (how many people are?) but they&#39;re real. That makes them important. This is how people think. People give Plato credit for thinking strange thoughts; not so much for appreciating what &#39;regular&#39; people are like. But he gets it. And he gets that it works, for everyday purposes. Until it doesn&#39;t. In addition to the father-son pair, there is some important stage-dressing and backstory that we need to note about Book I. This is Plato&#39;s gateway into Republic. (Who knew the guys at the gates of utopia would be such regular guys? A retired businessman and his son.) We won&#39;t read the wh/ole book, but it&#39;s a good idea to have some idea what it contains.

WEEK 6 - Plato&#39;s Republic, Book I: Thrasymachus. We want to know what justice is. More specifically: we want to know whether it&#39;s necessarily in our self-interest to be just. Isn&#39;t justice just a second-best option for those who don&#39;t have what it takes to be tyrants? Even worse: isn&#39;t justice just whatever those who rule say it is. So: justice is the advantage of the stronger. Thrasymachus delights in his cynical stance, but even those in the audience who don&#39;t like him think maybe he&#39;s got a point. He&#39;s a much better debater than any of those others we&#39;ve met. In the end, he is refuted. And, like the others, it&#39;s hard to believe he&#39;s changed his mind. (So what&#39;s the point?) Final thoughts about egoism and altruism. 

WEEK 7 - Moral Psychology. I am going to discuss a popular &#39;positive psychology&#39; book, by Jonathan Haidt, The Happiness Hypothesis. It&#39;s a good book, and a useful snapshot of Plato&#39;s legacy. (No snapshot gives the whole picture, but we do what we can.) Haidt is, in some ways, very Platonic; in other ways, very anti-Platonic. (But even anti-Platonism is sort of Platonism. As Barnum said: no such thing as bad publicity!) Like Plato, Haidt is interested in providing a basically rational account of how the moral mind works - which is to say, pretty irrationally, a lot of the time. He wants to improve our knowledge and have it make a real ethical difference. Past this point, we get into deep disagreements, which have to do - but don&#39;t reduce to - basic disagreements about how science works. A few final thoughts about Haidt&#39;s newer book, The Righteous Mind. 

WEEK 8 – Ethics and Ethnos. We end, where we began, thinking about the ways in-group/out-group relations structure our ethical thinking. (This is Euthyphro&#39;s problem: should you turn dad in for murder?) There is no single reading for this week, but I will attempt to give a good sense of the way the debate spreads out from here, by quoting bits and summarizing arguments from various authors. We could say that the issue is &#39;cosmopolitanism&#39;. Should I be a citizen of the cosmos! (not merely a member of my local tribe.) But that&#39;s a bad translation. Too galactic! The cosmopolitan is a citizen of the just - the well-ordered - political order, as opposed to the political order that happens to obtain on this particular stretch of earth. And so we relate in-group/out-group thinking to utopian/anti-utopian thinking. And we are done.

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Recommender systems have changed the way people find products, information, and even other people. They study patterns of behavior to know what someone will prefer from among a collection of things he has never experienced. The technology behind recommender systems has evolved over the past 20 years into a rich collection of tools that enable the practitioner or researcher to develop effective recommenders. We will study the most important of those tools, including how they work, how to use them, how to evaluate them, and their strengths and weaknesses in practice.

The algorithms we will study include content-based filtering, user-user collaborative filtering, item-item collaborative filtering, dimensionality reduction, and interactive critique-based recommenders. The approach will be hands-on, with six two week projects, each of which will involve implementation and evaluation of some type of recommender.

In addition to topical lectures, this course includes interviews and guest lectures with experts from both academia and industry.

Two Ways to Take this Course:

This course is designed to support two different types of students and educational goals:

Programming Track:  Designed for students with significant programming and mathematics experience (see below), the programming track combines a conceptual and mathematical understanding of recommender systems with experience programming six different recommender systems projects.  Students completing this travel will gain the skills needed to implement basic recommenders from scratch, and to use software libraries and tools to implement more advanced recommenders.

Concepts Track:  Students who are not experienced programmers, or who are primarily interested in understanding the concepts and techniques of recommender systems, without learning to program them, can choose to focus on the conceptual and mathematical content, skipping the programming projects and associated lecture content.  Students in the concepts track are still expected to have significant familiarity with computing systems and college-level mathematics, but need not be accomplished programmers.  We expect this track to be useful for tech-savvy marketing and business leaders, as well as engineering managers who may oversee but not directly develop recommender systems.  We also hope it will be useful to those looking to understand recommender systems concepts without the workload associated with programming those systems.

Conclusion 

Recommended Background
For the Concepts Track students should have a basic familiarity with college-level algebra and a general understanding of computer systems concepts.

For the Programming Track students should have significant skill in Java programming, basic data structures, college-level algebra, and the ability to install and manage sophisticated software development tools and libraries.  Programming track students will install and use significant open-source software tools. Therefore, a special lecture in the first week of class will identify the tool and installation options for various computing platforms.
Suggested Readings
Specific readings will be identified to accompany particular lectures or assignments.  All such readings will be available to students online.  Those interested in an introductory text are invited to consider Recommender Systems: An Introduction by Jannach et al.  
Course Format
Course content will consist of lecture videos (with PDFs of used slides available), online resources including review and research articles, and online discussion forums.  Additionally, we will be recording live Q&amp;A and discussion sessions held with students enrolled for credit at the University of Minnesota; at those sessions, we will be addressing many of the top-scoring questions from the class forums.  

Course evaluation will include three components:  written assignments, quizzes, and programming assignments (programming track only).  While many assignments will be automatically graded, some will use peer grading; students must complete peer grading to earn credit for their own submission.  


FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment for this Course?

Yes, students who complete the course with sufficiently high scores will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructors.  For the programming track, we will award a certificate of distinguished accomplishment to students who receive 80% or more of the possible points in the course.  We will award a certificate of accomplishment to any student who receives 50% or more of the total points possible in the course -- a level that can be achieved by students in the concepts track as well.</field>

What is the nature of our relationship to others and the world? How can literature help us see these relationships more clearly? This course seeks to explore such questions through adventurous readings of ten great works of narrative fiction from the 18th to the 20th century.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
As individuals we are defined by relationships, by our connection to people, places, and things. Such connectedness can be not only emotional or erotic or political or environmental, but even textual, enacted through writing. In this course we explore the nature and meaning of such connections in ten major works of narrative fiction from the 18th century to the present. These include: Manon Lescaut by Abbé Prévost; two works by Herman Melville, Bartleby the Scrivener and Benito Cereno; Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre; two stories by Franz Kafka, “The Metamorphosis” and “The Country Doctor”; Virginia Woolf’s To the Lighthouse; William Faulkner’s Light in August;  an anthology of stories, Ficciones, by Jorge Luis Borges; The Ice Palace by Tarjei Vesaas; Tony Morrison’s Beloved; and Disgrace by J.M. Coetzee.

As this course will demonstrate, the most critical relationships in our lives—the linkages both known and unknown—are not always easy to get a fix on, but literature offers us a special sighting on these arrangements. Through exploratory readings of these narrative works, the course will seek to make relationship visible, bringing our traffic with the world and with others into clearer focus.

Course Syllabus
Abbé Prévost, Manon Lescaut (1731)
Charlotte Brontë, Jane Eyre (1847)

What social and ideological mechanisms allowed Jews to survive and even flourish in Catholic Italy? And under what circumstances did the practice of tolerance break down? This course takes a different approach to the idea of tolerance, as well as to the long, complicated history of the Catholic Church and the Jews.

Preview Lectures</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Discussions of the centuries-long relationship between Christianity and the Jews are almost always framed in terms of persecution and discrimination with only occasional examples of toleration and kindness. To explain or to excuse the ongoing hatred towards Jews, historians mix together terminologies and concepts drawn from religious theology, psychology, social theory and politics. The catch-all term &quot;anti-Semitism&quot; lumps together outbreaks of prejudice and victimization in different times and places.

In this course, we shall ask a different question. Our focus is not on why a majority society saw Jews as different or reacted with violence to Jews&#39; &quot;otherness.&quot; Rather, we ask how in a society dedicated to religious uniformity one group of people was tolerated even though it refused to join the dominant faith. Many modern writers assume that Christianity, and perhaps religion itself, is inherently intolerant of non-believers. But we will see that neither religious nor secular world views necessarily lead to toleration or discrimination. The patterns of Christian-Jewish relations are both complex and intriguing.

Our question then is how did a religious society manage to practice tolerance, and under what circumstances did that practice break down? We will focus on the history of Jews in Italy and especially Rome, the city that housed the the longest continuous Jewish settlement in world history and that was also, for most of the past two millennia, the home of the Catholic Church.

After each lecture there will be a short quiz that will allow you to judge how well you have understood the material. 

There are two opportunities to write analytical essays for the course; these will be reviewed by your fellow students.

I estimate that students should be able to cover the lecture, readings, and assignments in three to six hours per week. Of course you are encouraged to spend more time in order to explore the topics more fully .
FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class and pass the final examination will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor. 

What resources will I need for this class?
For this course, all you need is an Internet connection, copies of the texts (all of which can be obtained for free), and the time to read, write, discuss, and enjoy the life of the mind.

What is the coolest thing I&#39;ll learn if I take this class?
In addition to reading the works of some of the greatest figures in the history of Christianity and Judaism, you will learn how historians rethink old problems by asking new questions. This course aims to help everyone think more imaginatively, read more deeply, and write more powerfully.</field>

Early Renaissance Architecture in Italy: from Alberti to Bramante

When Leon Battista Alberti completed his treatise about architecture around 1452, his initial study of texts and monuments of Antiquity was based on mathematics and geometry as a reflection of nature, with a belief that architecture was a part of a man&#39;s civil duty.

This attitude would condition the architectural principles of the early Renaissance and architects did not apply themselves to textual imitations of individual antique monuments. In Florence, they preferred to accept and articulate the rational “system” of Brunelleschi, either transforming it, like Alberti, or breaking with it in a return to tradition, like Michelozzo. In north and south Italy, the battle between innovation and resistance was increasing in strength and substance because it not only encompassed immediate questions of decorative language  (antique forms and architectural orders) but also the problems of conceiving and constructing an architecture that could replace the gothic structural membering with the continuous masonry of the Antiquity. At first, the new decoration was frequently adapted to the existing architectural system, and only later did it find a partner in the different spatial and structural conceptions that descended from Florentine exempla. The tendency to see norms and models in antique architecture, which must be rigidly replicated, first affirmed itself at the beginning of the XVI century in Rome.

Through some of the most celebrated examples of the early Renaissance architecture and the most important statements of the early Renaissance theories, the course will examine problems of the architectural spaces, technology and forms in the XV century in Italy, from Leon Battista Alberti’s to Francesco di Giorgio’s and Bramante’s proposals.

This course will discuss various aspects of the Renminbi internationalization, including the reform of the international monetary system, the opportunities and challenges to internationalize the Renminbi, the evolution of China&#39;s monetary and exchange rate policies, and the implications of the Renminbi internationalization for Hong Kong.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
The current international monetary system has critical defects. An effective reform of the system calls for a new international currency, for which the Renminbi may be a promising candidate. Despite the rapid growth of the Chinese economy, certain prerequisites have to be satisfied before the Renminbi can be internationalized. China needs to ensure full convertibility of the Renminbi and further develop its financial markets to facilitate the process of internationalization.

This course will discuss various aspects of the Renminbi internationalization. Specifically, innovative suggestions will be provided on topics including the reform of the international monetary system, the opportunities and challenges of the Renminbi internationalization, and the evolution of China’s monetary and exchange rate policies. Since the internationalization of Renminbi is important to the future of Hong Kong as an international financial center, the lectures will also discuss the possible implications of this process for Hong Kong.

Course Syllabus
Week 1: The Role of the Renminbi in the International Monetary System

The lecture will commence with a review on the roles of money in the domestic and international monetary systems. Upon analyzing the critical defects of the international monetary system and the necessity of reform, we will discuss the global governance and institutional reform of the international monetary system. An assessment on the costs and benefits associated with the internationalization of the Renminbi for the system will conclude the lecture.

Week 2: Internationalization of the Renminbi and Renminbi Offshore Markets

This lecture will address the following questions: What are the aims of internationalizing the Renminbi? What analytical framework can we adopt to draft proposals on the possible process of Renminbi internationalization? For China, what are the costs and benefits of establishing Renminbi offshore markets? How can the risks to monetary and financial stability be managed prudently? What are the implications for other areas, particularly Hong Kong?

Week 3: The Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy of China

The lecture will begin with an analysis on the approaches, instruments, and intermediate targets of China’s monetary policy. The legal framework of monetary regulation, the role of the central bank, and the objective of monetary policies will then be elaborated, followed by a brief discussion on the interest rate and exchange rate liberalization. The lecture will then proceed to review the monetary policy stance of the People’s Bank of China over the years and discuss the recent experience of monetary policymaking in China.

Week 4: The Future of Hong Kong’s Monetary System

This lecture will focus on the monetary system of Hong Kong. We will review the history of Hong Kong’s monetary policy and monetary control, thus revealing how the monetary system of Hong Kong has been designed to serve the public interest most effectively and maintain Hong Kong as an international financial center. The lecture will conclude with a discussion on the future of the Linked Exchange Rate System, which has served Hong Kong well for almost 30 years.

Recommended Background
This course is suitable for students who are interested in the development of China&#39;s monetary system. No mathematical models will be taught in the class.
Course Format
There will be 2-3 lectures per week, each lasting 10-20 minutes in the form of a video clip.  Open-ended questions will be assigned after each lecture for discussion in the forum. Students are required to complete a test of 40 multiple-choice questions at the end of the course.

FAQ

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This course focuses on the concepts and tools behind reporting modern data analyses in a reproducible manner. Reproducible research is the idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them.  The need for reproducibility is increasing dramatically as data analyses become more complex, involving larger datasets and more sophisticated computations. Reproducibility allows for people to focus on the actual content of a data analysis, rather than on superficial details reported in a written summary. In addition, reproducibility makes an analysis more useful to others because the data and code that actually conducted the analysis are available. This course will focus on literate statistical analysis tools which allow one to publish data analyses in a single document that allows others to easily execute the same analysis to obtain the same results.
Course Syllabus
In this course you will learn to write a document using R markdown, integrate live R code into a literate statistical program, compile R markdown documents using knitr and related tools, and organize a data analysis so that it is reproducible and accessible to others.
Recommended Background
R Programming, Data Scientist&#39;s Toolbox
Course Format
There will be weekly video lectures,  quizzes, peer assessments.

As part of this class you will be required to set up a GitHub and an RPubs account. GitHub is a tool for collaborative code sharing and editing. RPubs is a web site for publishing data analyses from R. During this course and other courses in the Specialization you will be submitting links to files you publicly place in your GitHub account as part of peer evaluation. If you are concerned about preserving your anonymity you will need to set up an anonymous GitHub and RPubs accounts and be careful not to include any information you do not want made available to peer evaluators.
FAQ
How do the courses in the Data Science Specialization depend on each other?
We have created a handy course dependency chart to help you see how the nine courses in the specialization depend on each other.

Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.

What resources will I need for this class?
A computer is needed on which the R software environment can be installed (recent Mac, Windows, or Linux computers are sufficient).

How does this course fit into the Data Science Specialization?
This is the fifth course in the Specialization. We strongly recommend that you first take The Data Scientist&#39;s Toolbox and R Programming before taking this course.</field>

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Children around the world experience severe adversity in different forms, including maltreatment, disaster, war, and terrorism. Some children manage to adapt and recover, showing resilience, while others do not. What do we know about resilience and how to protect child development in the face of potentially life-altering adversities? This course will examine the global literature on resilience in children and youth, with a focus on core concepts, methods scholars use to study resilience, highlights of lessons learned from half a century of research, and applications to promote resilience in children whose lives are threatened by extreme adversity.

Course materials will examine multimedia biographies as well as research studies on the effects of common and rare traumatic experiences on child development. Both classic and contemporary studies of risk and resilience in children facing the following kinds of adversities will be included

natural disasters (eg, tsunami, hurricane, earthquake) 
political violence and war (eg, child soldiers, refugees) 
terror attacks (eg, 9/11, Beslan school) 
compound mass-trauma events (eg, 2011 earthquake - tsunami - nuclear plant meltdown) 
child maltreatment 
severe poverty or privation 
The course also will highlight new frontiers of research on the neurobiology of resilience, cultural protective processes, and preventive interventions to promote the capacity for resilience in young people.

The course has been designed for relevance to students and professionals from multiple disciplines, diverse backgrounds, and different regions of the globe. Participants completing the course will gain a basic understanding of concepts and methods of research on resilience in children and youth, major findings from the first half-century of science on this topic, and a broad framework for applications of this growing knowledge to improve the lives of children threatened by hazardous circumstances.

Suggested Readings
The illustrated lectures are designed to be self-contained but we strongly recommend Diana E. E. Kleiner, Roman Architecture: A Visual Guide (Yale University Press, 2014). This interactive e-book is a companion to the Roman Architecture course, featuring chapter overviews for the major time periods, sites, and monuments and concise interpretations of the most important buildings in the Roman Empire, illustrated in over 250 photographs and site plans. They provide the “Monument Lists” mentioned in the lectures and are presented primarily through my own digital images. Above all, these custom created resources make learning easier than ever with maps, pop up references, visual book navigation, geolocation links, flashcards, and recommendations for further reading. 

Roman Architecture: A Visual Guide is available from Apple iBooks. Click here to purchase the iBooks version. 

The e-book is also available for Amazon Kindle. Click here to purchase for Amazon Kindle. 
Course Format
In order to explore the expansive reach of the Roman Empire, the course encompasses the full spring semester (15 weeks) and is coordinated with the Roman Architecture class I’ll teach concurrently at Yale. This provides an unprecedented opportunity to connect Coursera and Yale students in occasional collaborative learning activities, which will be announced along the way. Most weeks have two sets of video lectures, divided into five or six sections of 15-20 minutes in length. Each video lecture is accompanied by in-video quiz questions to assess your comprehension and provide immediate feedback. These are machine graded, as are the two required Mastery Quizzes. Three required 250-word writing assignments on thought-provoking problem-solving questions are spread across the semester and require peer-review of other students’ work. These will be assigned on Monday of the designated weeks, giving you one week to complete them and a second week to peer grade. The capstone project is to Design Your Own Roman City. Two weeks without any lectures or other assignments are reserved for you to concentrate on the research and writing of the 500-word city design paper, accompanied by a city plan and drawing of one individual building. Throughout the course, we will be interacting in the online forum, in occasional video chats, and through Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook. Since this course is about architecture, capturing and displaying ancient Roman buildings and others that resemble them on Instagram should prove to be one of the most creative and exciting elements of the course.
FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?

Learn 3 high leverage ideas and techniques to thrive in your first (or fifteenth) year of teaching.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Frustration. Hard Knocks. Sleepless nights. Tears. 

Those are just a few of the ways that rookie teachers describe their first year in the profession. And those sentiments have been validated by countless research studies that show that students, on average, learn significantly less when they’re taught by rookies. Unfortunately, many educators believe this is a necessary “rite of passage” – a sort of hazing that one must experience on their path to effective teaching. 

We don’t believe that. 

Over the past 6 years, the Match Teacher Residency has developed and refined an approach to specifically address the challenges that are unique to the rookie teacher experience. In this four-week course, we’ll explore the three ideas that we&#39;ve found to contribute radically to success as a rookie teacher. 


“It&#39;s been a fantastic learning experience. I&#39;ve taken several Coursera courses and this one is definitely the most original and creative in its approach. I suppose its main advantage is the straightforwardness of teaching, clarity and impressive visual representation. Really looking forward to Part II, where rookie teachers may grow and develop their initial knowledge even further.”


“This was my first Coursera course and it was really helpful, although I am a 12th year teacher. One can never say that he/she can manage the class successfully every day, every hour. All the advise was very much appreciated. Many thanks to all: Orin, Ross, and Kat. I await your next steps!



“I am happy to report that it has come in VERY handy in my subbing jobs, in not only helping get the classroom management under control at the start of each period, but in keeping control for the rest of the period.  I even used it again yesterday, at another charter school where I sub only occasionally, and where the students are also a handful to manage.  I know the regular staff noticed and saw the effects.  So, it seems I&#39;m racking up points towards some good references when I do apply for a permanent position!  I have this course to thank for taking me from being an ‘adequate’ sub to being an ‘outstanding’ one!”



Course Syllabus
1. Develop Classroom Management Automaticity

Certain skills that delay a novice are automatic for an expert. Dribbling a basketball. Driving a car. Addressing classroom misbehavior is similarly difficult for a novice and effortless for an expert. At one moment the novice teacher might let a particular misbehavior slide entirely; at another they might respond too harshly; and at yet another they might respond with halting uncertainty. In this part of our course, we’ll cover concrete techniques and exercises that can help a rookie teacher develop the classroom management automaticity of an expert. 

2. Practice Good Ratio 

Teachers love the spotlight. Often, a natural taste for being the center of attention might have drawn somebody to teaching in the first place. But we’ve concluded that there’s an inverse relationship between a teacher’s talking and his/her students’ learning: the more you talk, the less they learn. Doug Lemov from Uncommon Schools first coined the term “Ratio:” the amount of teacher work in a lesson compared to the amount of student work. Rookie teachers tend to have very bad Ratio because they often spend more energy thinking about their lessons in terms of what they want to say rather than what they want their students to do. In this part of our course, we’ll address when and how to use specific techniques such as “Turn and Talks” and “Stop and Jots” and “Student-to-Student Interactions” to get students to do more of the intellectual heavy-lifting in lessons. 

3. Call Parents

Many preparation programs counsel new teachers to build positive relationships with parents, but few show them exactly how to approach that work. Lacking those details, it’s no surprise that rookie teachers quickly become overwhelmed by all of the aspects of their job that seem more pressing and urgent. “Sure it would be nice to have better relationships with parents, but it certainly doesn’t feel like a priority, when I’m drowning in papers to grade, lessons to plan and a messy class to organize!” We understand that sentiment, but we believe a teacher should view his/her investment of time in building relationships with parents as a key strategy for motivating students to give more effort in class. In this part of the course, we will very precisely show teachers how much time to spend phoning parents, what to say, and how to say it. 

Recommended Background
While this course is intended for pre-service teachers, rookie teachers, and instructional coaches, veteran teachers and people considering moving into the profession have also found this course very worthwhile.  
Course Format
This course is expected to have four highly interactive 30 minute sessions that are a mix of lecture, videos of classroom practice, and conversations with experienced teachers. Each week will also included a supplementary reading to reinforce or examine in more depth that week&#39;s content. 

Students will be assessed via two mechanisms: (1) Multiple choice quizzes that address descriptions of key concepts; and (2) short-answer analysis and description of teaching techniques. Peer assessment is required for the short-answer writing exercises. The course instructional team will schedule times after each session for interacting with students via the course’s Discussion Board.</field>

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
The main focus of this course is to look at the interrelations between different types of contexts (cultural, institutional, professional, social, interpersonal and others) within the intercultural communication process using Russian – Western communication as an example.

The purpose of the course is to provide the students with a broad overview of the basic principles governing past, present and future interactions between Russia and the West focused on the culture and national psychology of Russians and Western Europeans.

This course looks at the cases when Russian basic cultural values show up through linguistic choices shaping language production which is consequently misattributed by Western partners.  No matter what the language of intercultural communication is - Russian, or English - the meaning of many linguistic expressions may be reconstructed wrongly by the representatives of another culture.

 

We will tackle some basic questions:

What are concepts of culture that have most influence on communication?
What are Russian basic cultural values and how they shape modern Russian consciousness?
 What are specific communication patterns of modern Russian, including that of public and electronic discourse?
What is important to know about communication with Russians in organizational contexts?

This course is NOT just a list of instructions of what to do and not to do while dealing with Russians

In many ways Scandinavian film and television is a global cultural brand, connected with and exporting some of the cultural and social values connected to a liberal and progressive welfare society. This course deals with the social, institutional and cultural background of film and television in Scandinavia and in a broader European and global context.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Scandinavia is well known internationally for its welfare society, and part of this welfare society is a very developed cultural policy based on both the free market and public support. Scandinavia has a strong film and television culture with institutions and traditions created to secure creative diversity for both national, Scandinavian and global audiences. In many ways Scandinavian film and television is a global cultural brand, connected with and exporting some of the cultural and social values connected to a liberal and progressive welfare society. Dating back to the silent cinema era and through the birth of a modern film and television culture after 1945 Scandinavia has contributed significantly to our global cultural heritage.

This course in Scandinavian Film and Television deals with the social, institutional and cultural background of film and television in Scandinavia and in a broader European and global context. The course will offer a deeper understanding of the creative forces behind film and television, of how Scandinavian society and culture has influenced the production. The course will deal with the co-production in Scandinavia and the role of Scandinavian film and television internationally. Theoretically the course will deal with national and global cinema, with film and media sociology, with genre and auteur theory and with film and media policy.

The course will also deal with some of the most important film directors and film and television genres and the way they have reflected and influenced our understanding of Scandinavia and the image of Scandinavian culture and society abroad. From Carl Th. Dreyer’s complex historical and religious dramas, Ingmar Bergman’s symbolic and psychological films to the modern cinema of Lars von Trier, Aki Kaurismäki, Lukas Moodyson and Bent Hamer - all important Scandinavian names in a broader European art cinema tradition.  The course will deal with typical examples of other and more popular genres in Scandinavian cinema and modern, Scandinavian television drama and with aspects of the Scandinavian documentary tradition. Examples include Jan Troell’s epic serial The Immigrants/The New Land (1971-72), global, prize winning drama series like The Killing (2007-12) and Borgen (2010-) and international film blockbusters such as the Stieg Larson trilogy.

Programming-oriented course on effectively using modern computers to solve scientific computing problems arising in the physical/engineering sciences and other fields. Provides an introduction to efficient serial and parallel computing using Fortran 90, OpenMP, MPI, and Python, and software development tools such as version control, Makefiles, and debugging.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Computation and simulation are increasingly important in all aspects of science and engineering. At the same time writing efficient computer programs to take full advantage of current computers is becoming increasingly difficult. Even laptops now have 4 or more processors, but using them all to solve a single problem faster often requires rethinking the algorithm to introduce parallelism, and then programming in a language that can express this parallelism.  Writing efficient programs also requires some knowledge of machine arithmetic, computer architecture, and memory hierarchies.

Although parallel computing will be covered, this is not a class on the most advanced techniques for using supercomputers, which these days have tens of thousands of processors and cost millions of dollars. Instead, the goal is to teach tools that you can use immediately on your own laptop, desktop, or a small cluster. Cloud computing will also be discussed, and students who don&#39;t have a multiprocessor computer of their own will still be able to do projects using Amazon Web Services at very low cost.

Along the way there will also be discussion of software engineering tools such as debuggers, unit testing, Makefiles, and the use of version control systems. After all, your time is more valuable than computer time, and a program that runs fast is totally useless if it produces the wrong results.

High performance programming is also an important aspect of high performance scientific computing, and so another main theme of the course is the use of basic tools and techniques to improve your efficiency as a computational scientist.

Course Syllabus
The use of a variety of languages and techniques will be integrated throughout the course as much as possible, rather than taught linearly. The topics below will be covered at an introductory level, with the goal of learning enough to feel comfortable starting to use them in your everyday work. Once you&#39;ve reached that level, abundant resources are available on the web to learn the more advanced features that are most relevant for you.

Working at the command line in Unix-like shells (e.g. Linux or a Mac OSX terminal).
Version control systems, particularly git, and the use of Github and Bitbucket repositories.
Work habits for documentation of your code and reproducibility of your results.
Interactive Python using IPython, and the IPython Notebook.
Python scripting and its uses in scientific computing.
Subtleties of computer arithmetic that can affect program correctness.
How numbers are stored: binary vs. ASCII representations, efficient I/O.
Fortran 90, a compiled language that is widely used in scientific computing.
Makefiles for building software and checking dependencies.
The high cost of data communication.  Registers, cache, main memory, and how this memory hierarchy affects code performance. 
OpenMP on top of Fortran for parallel programming of shared memory computers, such as a multicore laptop.
 MPI on top of Fortran for distributed memory parallel programming, such as on a cluster.
Parallel computing in IPython.
Debuggers, unit tests, regression tests, verification and validation of computer codes.
Graphics and visualization of computational results using Python.
Recommended Background
Experience writing and debugging computer programs is required : 
Preferably experience with scientific, mathematical, or statistical computing, for example in Matlab or R. (Previous knowledge of Fortran, Python, or parallel computing languages is not assumed.)

Students should also be comfortable with undergraduate mathematics, particularly calculus and linear algebra, which is pervasive in scientific computing applications. Many of the examples used in lectures and assignments will require this background. Past exposure to numerical analysis is a plus.

All of the software used in this course is open source and freely available. A Virtual Machine will be provided that can be used to create a Linux desktop environment (with all of the required software pre-installed) that can be run on any operating system using the free VirtualBox software. An Amazon Web Services AMI will also be provided to allow doing the course work in the cloud.

Suggested Readings
Course notes will be provided to compliment lectures. The notes and slides from lectures will also contain many references to other free resources on the web, along with some recommended books on the topics covered.

Course Format
The class will consist of lecture videos with integrated quiz questions. There will also be programming assignments that are not part of the lectures and optional reading material.</field>

This course is designed to guide science educators towards an understanding of the Framework for K-12 Science Education and how, when integrated with the Scientific and Engineering Design Practices and Crosscutting Concepts are the basis for classroom instruction using the Next Generation Science Standards.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
The Scientific and Engineering Practices as outlined in A Framework for K-12 Science Education, provide the basis for students to gain a deeper understanding science content through the use of hands-on science investigations and engineering design activities.  Often investigations remain as engaging activities without adding depth to the students’ understanding of the science core ideas. Research-based instructional strategies utilized in STEM programs require a more rigorous approach to describing the scientific ideas that underlie the activity. 

The question becomes:

As teachers begin to address the Science Core Disciplinary Ideas through the lens of STEM (Science, Engineering, Technology and Mathematics), how and why should the Scientific and Engineering Design Practices be integrated into investigations?

Using the Framework for K-12 Science Education can be the basis for this depth of understanding by:

·       Providing research-based science core disciplinary ideas

·       Connecting the ideas with Cross-cutting concepts

·       Utilizing scientific and engineering practices and

·       Providing guidance in the assessment of the depth of knowledge gained by students and a measure of achievement in understanding the core disciplinary ideas in science.

Course Syllabus
Week 1: Learn about the Framework for K-12 Science Education and how it is organized by Practices, Crosscutting Concepts and Core Ideas for one specific grade level or content strand.  Understand how the organization of the Framework will guide teachers in the development of deeper student understanding in science. Analyze a Performance Expectation (PE) for one of the NGSS and determine how the three strands are embedded in the PE.

Week 2: Explore the Disciplinary Core Ideas as outlined in the K-12 Framework for Science Education by the NRC. Based on your understanding of how these are vertically alinged from K-6, and for secondary science, compare the alignment to a set of education standards used in your community. 

Week 3: Scientific and Engineering Practices to understand how they are similar processes with very different outcomes.  Based on an understanding of how these practices are utilized by the STEM Workforce, analyze how each practice is used in a relevant, real-world problem-based situation.

Week 4: Explore the Crosscutting Concepts as outlined in the K-12 Framework for Science Education by the NRC.  Determine how they are used within the Framework to build a deeper understanding of the DCI to which it is attached.  Compare the use of the CCC within the NGSS compared to the education standards of your community.

Comprehensive Assignment:  Using the alignment of the components of the NGSS and your local science education standards for one specific grade level and concept, compare and contrast the comprehensive nature of both standards in meeting the needs of your school system now and in the future, for the instruction of science education.

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This course introduces software defined networking, an emerging paradigm in computer networking that allows a logically centralized software program to control the behavior of an entire network.  

Separating a network&#39;s control logic from the underlying physical routers and switches that forward traffic allows network operators to write high-level control programs that specify the behavior of an entire network, in contrast to conventional networks, whereby network operators must codify functionality in terms of low-level device configuration.  

Logically centralized network control makes it possible for operators to specify more complex tasks that involve integrating many disjoint network functions (e.g., security, resource control, prioritization) into a single control framework, allowing network operators to create more sophisticated policies, and making network configurations easier to configure, manage, troubleshoot, and debug. 

 

Course Syllabus
This course will cover 8 modules over the 6 week period.

Module 1: History and evolution of SDN

Module 2: Control and data plane separation

Module 3: Virtual networking

Modules 4 &amp; 5 : SDN Nuts and Bolts

—Control Plane

—Data Plane

Module 6: Programming SDNs

Modules 7: Use Cases

Module 8: Looking Forward

Recommended Background
Students should have taken at least an undergraduate-level networking course and have programming experience in Python.  Experience with virtual machines and other virtual networking environments may also be useful.

Suggested Readings
There are some useful videos available online; these might be a good starting point for many people:

 Prof. Nick McKeown, Stanford
&quot;How SDN will Shape Networking&quot;
 Prof. Scott Shenker, Berkeley:
&quot;An attempt to motivate and clarify Software-Defined Networking (SDN)&quot;
(watch the first 35 minutes or so)

You may find the additional reading useful for introductory material:
  OpenFlow: Basic description of OpenFlow
  Open Networking Foundation: For recent OpenFlow specifications, etc.
  Mininet: Environment that allows you to emulate OpenFlow networks on a laptop.
Course Format
The course will consist of a series of video lectures, each about 10 minutes in length.

Assignments for the course will be lab-based programming assignments, likely building off of the Mininet software developed at Stanford University, which can run SDNs in emulated environments on networks of virtual machines.

 

FAQ
What resources will I need for this class? 
We will use the mininet programming environment for many of the assignments for this course.  You will want to develop some proficiency setting up virtual networks in this environment.  In the first portion of the course, we will provide simple mininet tutorials, so it should be fairly easy to come up to speed.  You should, however, have proficiency with basic networking concepts and facility with configuring networking in Linux environments.

What is the coolest thing I&#39;ll learn if I take this class?

You’ll learn how to use software programs to perform varying and complex networking tasks, ranging from usage management and resource control to implementation of more complicated network security policies.</field>

The purpose of this course is to help participants and the organizations they encounter survive the waves of technological disruptions facing business, government, education and their daily lives.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course

The purpose of this course is to help individuals and organizations survive when confronted with disruptive technologies that threaten their current way of life.  We will look at a general model of survival and use it to analyze companies and industries that have failed or are close to failing.  Examples of companies that have not survived include Kodak, a firm over 100 years old, Blockbuster and Borders.   It is likely that each of us has done business with all of these firms, and today Kodak and Blockbuster are in bankruptcy and Borders has been liquidated.  Disruptions are impacting industries like education; Coursera and others offering these massive open online courses are a challenge for Universities.  In addition to firms that have failed, we will look at some that have survived and are doing well.  What are their strategies for survival?

By highlighting the reasons for the decline of firms and industries, participants can begin to understand how to keep the same thing from happening to them.   Through the study of successful organizations, we will try to tease out approaches to disruptions that actually work.  Our ultimate objective is to develop a strategy for survival in a world confronting one disruptive technology after another.

Course Syllabus
1. Survival: a simple model of the incumbent’s dilemma of how to respond to a potentially disruptive technology .
2. Kodak misses its moment: the story of Kodak and how, after inventing the digital camera, it failed to understand how it and the Internet changed the process of capturing and sharing images.
3. Blockbuster vs Netflix.  How could a leading company fail to respond to a clearly defined threat from a new competitor?
4. Borders:  was the company asleep when Amazon came along and disrupted book sales, publishing and reading?
5. The three amigos: what can we learn from Kodak, Borders and Blockbuster as a group of failed companies?
6. Can I borrow your paper?   How the Internet has savaged one of our oldest types of media leading to the slow death of newspapers.
7. Books and Publishers:  trying to maintain two business models at once.
8. Education: the industry that moves at a glacial pace faces radical innovation from non-profits to Coursera.
9. Dictators: probably not a promising occupation given social media-how the Arab spring changed a profession.
10. Risky business-are innovations in technology encouraging us to engage in too much risky business?
11. Moving things: will the USPS disappear?  How can it compete with UPS and FedEx?
12. Some survivors:  a few have managed to incorporate disruptive technologies into their lives and to flourish, at least for now.
13.  Danger ahead: what new disruptions are on the horizon and who will be disrupted?
14. Strategies for survival: suggestions on  how to deal with disruptive technologies and turn them into a successful innovation
Recommended Background
The course should appeal most to participants who have at least a general interest in new technologies and in the economy.  It would be helpful for you to following the general business press including web sites or print media of periodicals like The New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg’s BusinessWeek, IEEE Spectrum, Technology Today and similar information sources.

Christensen, C. M. The Innovator&#39;s Dilemma. Boston: Harvard Business School Press, 1997

Course Format
The course will consist of short videos each week that deal with the topics in the syllabus above.  You will be asked to complete different readings and answer questions about them.  There will also be questions that you answer by conducting research on the Web.  There will be discussion questions for participants to answer each week, and occasional essays that will be reviewed by peers.  There will also be quizzes where you can demonstrate your understanding of the material in the course.

FAQ
What resources will I need for this class?

You will gain the most from this class if you are willing to “think the unthinkable,” to envision order of magnitude changes in existing ways of doing things and make fearless predictions about the likely impact of a new technology.

What is the coolest thing I’ll learn if I take this class?

You’ll learn how to respond to the waves of technological disruptions that are impacting business and government organizations and educational institutions.  You will learn how to be a survivor of the massive changes in the way we live and work that are happening now and will continue into the future.

Will I get a certificate after this class

Yes, students who successfully complete the class will get a certificate signed by the instructor.</field>

Admit it — you wanted to be an archaeologist when you grew up... This course builds on that enthusiasm, while radically expanding your notions about just what archaeology is and just what archaeologists do.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
In this class, we will ask and answer a series of questions about the role and practice of archaeology in the world today. If archaeologists are trained to investigate the past, what is left for us to study?  Who gets to be an archaeologist?  How and why do archaeologists hunt for “treasures”, and what do we do once we’ve discovered them?  What can we know, and not know, about people in the past?  What do archaeologists know about the past that most people would never guess – and why aren’t we telling you?  Why are people entirely willing to murder each other over the fate of archaeological sites?  Are Real Men alone capable of discovering the truth behind all this?

Archaeology famously involves getting dirty in the line of duty.  Students will experience its hands-on nature, through the use of numerous exercises and archaeological case studies.  But there are other ‘dirty little secrets’ to learn about the field: not least how the stories archaeologists tell about the past have been used and abused, for purposes both good and bad.  Our goal by the end of the course is to have you ‘thinking like an archaeologist’ and fully aware of the often-fraught politics of doing archaeology around the globe.    
Course Syllabus
Unit #1:  Just what are these secrets anyway?

Unit #2:  What has survived for us to find?  And what have we lost?

Unit #3:  So how do you find things?  Archaeology ≠ just digging

Unit #4:  How do you get a date? (And why are dates so important?)

Unit #5:  What do you do with what you find?

Unit #6:  What is involved in the archaeology of people?

Unit #7:  Where does archaeology happen?   Who can play?

Unit #8:  Who owns the past?

Recommended Background
Absolutely no prerequisites.  Just be curious.

Suggested Readings
While there will be a small number of required readings for each unit, all of these will be available on line without charge.  But if you want something that will take you further, I recommend Colin Renfrew and Paul Bahn, Archaeology: Theories, Methods and Practice (6th edition, Thames &amp; Hudson 2012).  All you might want to know and then some!  If you want something a little more introductory and streamlined, the same authors have produced Archaeology Essentials: Theories, Methods and Practice (Thames &amp; Hudson 2011).

FAQ
Will I get a statement of accomplishment after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a statement of accomplishment signed by the instructor.
What resources will I need for this class?
Computer, internet connection and a willingness to do some odd things.

	<field name="course_intro">Calculus Two: Sequences and Series
Calculus Two: Sequences and Series is an introduction to sequences, infinite series, convergence tests, and Taylor series. The course emphasizes not just getting answers, but asking the question &quot;why is this true?&quot;</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Sequences and Series will challenge us to think very carefully about
&quot;infinity.&quot;  What does it mean to add up an unending list of numbers?
How can an infinite task result in a finite answer?  These questions
lead us to some very deep concepts—but also to some powerful
computational tools which are used not only in math but in many
quantitative disciplines.

This course is a first and friendly introduction to sequences, infinite
series, convergence tests, and Taylor series.  It is suitable for
someone who has seen just a bit of calculus before.  And since one
learns mathematics by doing mathematics, this course encourages you to
participate by providing plenty of computational problems, conceptual
projects, and opportunities to explain your thought process to your
peers.

Course Syllabus
Week 1: Sequences
Week 2: Series
Week 3: Convergence tests
Week 4: Alternating series
Week 5: Power series
Week 6: Taylor series
Recommended Background
Some previous exposure to calculus will be helpful; limits, derivatives,
and integrals will all appear in this course.  If you are feeling rusty
or uncertain, I&#39;d encourage you to enroll to take a look.  You might
remember more than you think!
Suggested Readings
There are free calculus texts available, for example, http://www.whitman.edu/mathematics/multivariable/

We will be providing other free resources on the course homepage.
Course Format
This course offers lecture videos, randomly generated homework problems,
a free textbook, discussion forums, and weekly office hours to help you
understand sequences and series.  The course will finish with a final
exam.
FAQ
Will I get a statement of accomplishment after completing this class?
Yes. Students who earn 70% of the possible points will earn a statement signed by the instructor; students who earn 90% of the possible points will earn a statement with distinction signed by the instructor.

Other than an Internet connection, what resources will I need for this class?

Mathematics is a human activity: to participate, pen and paper is highly recommended.

What is the coolest thing I&#39;ll learn if I take this class?
The true nature of the real numbers!  Real numbers can be defined in
terms of sequences of... well, numbers.  This will turn out to be less
circular than it sounds.

How does this course relate to AP Calculus AB and AP Calculus BC?

This course is AP Calculus BC minus the AB, although this course is
missing some additional material on integrals which would be covered in
AP Calculus BC but isn&#39;t covered in AB.

Much of the content you&#39;d find in AP Calculus AB is covered in our other
Coursera course, Calculus One.</field>

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This course will look into the process of creating live site-specific choreography and performance works from conception, production to performance. Site-specific dance/performance is work created in response to a particular place or site, and is inspired by its architecture/design, the history and/or current use. We will investigate urban, architectural and environmental inspired site projects ranging from large-scale to small (guerrilla) style productions. We will delineate definitions of site-specificity, and look across the history of the field, focusing primarily on dance.

Specific techniques and approaches towards generating site-inspired choreography, developed over the last 25 years by site artist Stephan Koplowitz will be introduced. Aspects of navigating technical issues (lighting, sound, media) and a primer on producing (budgeting, obtaining permissions, insurance, fundraising, audience/event design) will also be covered.

Course Syllabus
Week 1: History and Context 
What is site-specific performance and dance? Through a number of examples, we&#39;ll define the genre through four distinct categories, and survey the range of site work in dance, performance, and installation-based practices.

Week 2: Working from the Outside In 
Dealing with pre-production decisions, such as selecting and assessing a site, and putting together a working budget.

Week 3: Research and Staging 
How to begin developing an artistic proposal for a site through a variety of set research &quot;filters.&quot;

Week 4: Production Elements 
How to generate content as it applies to site and the concept for your work, and a survey of what you need to consider in terms of sound or music, lighting, costumes and media.

Week 5: Creative and Production Challenges 
Safety issues; considerations when working in urban and natural environments; working with different production staff (costume, lighting, and sound designers) and other collaborators, such as composers or other artists; strategies for fundraising and marketing; and an overview of documenting your work.

Recommended Background
This course is designed for anyone interested in learning about site-specific dance and performance and how to create performance works outside of the proscenium stage. Prior site-specific experience in dance or theater is not required but prior experience in creating dance, theater or performance is recommended. Students from any of the creative arts (visual or performance) are welcome.
Suggested Readings
Site Dance : Choreographers and the Lure of Alternative Spaces, Edited by Melanie Kloetzel and Carolyn Pavlik, University Press of Florida.
This text is not required for the course but recommended to anyone interested in created site-specific works. 
Course Format
The class will consist of lecture videos of varying lengths, some contain 1-2 integrated quiz questions per video. There will also be 3 assignments and some required forum participation. 
FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?

Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.

What resources will I need for this class?

For this course, all you need is an Internet connection, the time to look at recommended links and the chance to investigate real sites and locations in response to assignments

What are some things I&#39;ll learn by taking this class?

The process of conceiving of site-specific work will alter your view of the environment around you, you&#39;ll find new inspiration to make art and you&#39;ll learn a specific methodology towards making performance works inspired by site. You&#39;ll also learn how to distinguish between different forms of site performance and make informed choices when working within this format.</field>

This course explores the relationship between slavery and democracy at the heart of American history. It is about the rise and fall of the slave South from the beginning of the seventeenth century to the end of the American Civil War.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Within the United States, the pre-Civil War South was a distinct region of plantations, enslaved labor, and agricultural production for the export market. It was always part of a global economy, tied into networks of capital, labor, and commodity markets that spanned continents. The wealth of the slave South was absolutely central to the political and economic growth of the U.S. and its emergence as a continental empire in the nineteenth century, but ultimately that system had to be destroyed for the country to claim its place as a world power.

Why that was – why the U.S. experienced a brutal Civil War in the 1860s – is a matter of considerable contention among scholars and a central theme of the course. The history of the South is a crucial part of the story of the rise of the U.S. as a global power and it is particularly compelling because of its history as a slaveholding society, the wealthiest in the western world in 1860. This course is about the ethical and political questions that history necessarily poses about the relationship between slavery, capitalism, and democracy in U.S. and world history.  It is about the rise and fall of the slave South from the beginning of the seventeenth century to the end of the American Civil War.

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Everything is connected: people, information, events and places, all the more so with the advent of online social media. A practical way of making sense of the tangle of connections is to analyze them as networks. In this course you will learn about the structure and evolution of networks, drawing on knowledge from disciplines as diverse as sociology, mathematics, computer science, economics, and physics. Online interactive demonstrations and hands-on analysis of real-world data sets will focus on a range of tasks: from identifying important nodes in the network, to detecting communities, to tracing information diffusion and opinion formation.
Course Syllabus
Week 1: What are networks and what use is it to study them?
Concepts: nodes, edges, adjacency matrix, one and two-mode networks, node degree
Activity: Upload a social network (e.g. your Facebook social network into Gephi and visualize it ).
Week 2: Random network models: Erdos-Renyi and Barabasi-Albert
Concepts: connected components, giant component, average shortest path, diameter, breadth-first search, preferential attachment
Activities: Create random networks, calculate component distribution, average shortest path, evaluate impact of structure on ability of information to diffuse
Week 3: Network centrality
Concepts: betweenness, closeness, eigenvector centrality (+ PageRank), network centralization
Activities: calculate and interpret node centrality for real-world networks (your Facebook graph, the Enron corporate email network, Twitter networks, etc.)
Week 4: Community
Concepts: clustering, community structure, modularity, overlapping communities
Activities: detect and interpret disjoint and overlapping communities in a variety of networks (scientific collaborations, political blogs, cooking ingredients, etc.)
Week 5: Small world network models, optimization, strategic network formation and search
Concepts: small worlds, geographic networks, decentralized search
Activity: Evaluate whether several real-world networks exhibit small world properties, simulate decentralized search on different topologies, evaluate effect of small-world topology on information diffusion.
Week 6: Contagion, opinion formation, coordination and cooperation
Concepts: simple contagion, threshold models, opinion formation
Activity: Evaluate via simulation the impact of network structure on the above processes
Week 7: Cool and unusual applications of SNA
Hidalgo et al. : Predicting economic development using product space networks (which countries produce which products)
Ahn et al., and Teng et al.: Learning about cooking from ingredient and flavor networks
Lusseau et al.: Social networks of dolphins
Activity: hands-on exploration of these networks using concepts learned earlier in the course
Week 8: SNA and online social networks
Concepts: how services such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, CouchSurfing, etc. are using SNA to understand their users and improve their functionality
Activity: read recent research by and based on these services and learn how SNA concepts were applied

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
We live in a world that is changing very quickly. Sociology gives us the tools to understand our own lives and those quite remote from us. The premise of this class is that in order to benefit from the sociological perspective, we need to learn how to ask certain basic questions. We need to know how to seek answers through methods that strive to be systematic and generalizable.We will begin with some of the essential questions: How are the things that we take to be natural socially constructed? How do we live today? How determined is social life? Does the individual make a difference? How is social order possible? Then we will ask what techniques are available to make sense of these questions.  We will review comparative, historical, demographic, experimental, and ethnographic methods. Along the way, we will study core concepts including ethnocentrism, social networks, community, unanticipated consequences, social capital, race, class, and gender. 

We will strive to understand how interaction in micro-level contexts affects larger social processes and how such macro-level processes influence our day to day lives. We will learn to conceive of inequality by asking how race, class, and gender work in tandem. We will address one of the crises of recent sociology -- whether we can actually isolate the effects of social context. We will think about how social science is changing at a time when we are literally swimming in oceans of data generated by the internet.

Suggested Readings
All assigned readings are open source materials which can be found through the web. You do not need to purchase anything. Although the lectures are designed to be self-contained, I will be recommending additional readings throughout the course for those who wish to delve further into particular topics. Students wanting to expand their knowledge beyond what will be covered in this six week summer class can find a much more extensive coverage in my books Essentials of Sociology (Third Edition) and Introduction to Sociology (Eighth Edition) (both with Anthony Giddens, Richard P. Appelbaum, and Deborah Carr).
Course Format
Each week, there will be two sessions. One will be a standard 50 minute lecture, segmented by interactive assessments, that refers to one or two readings, all of which are in the public domain. The other will be a live discussion session via a video chat room, in which eight students -- including some selected from the students in the online class and some here at Princeton -- will participate with me in a seminar about the readings. This session will be recorded so that if you are unable to watch it live, you can view it at your own convenience. It will be really nice to have at least some of you participating from around the world. And there will also be opportunities to contribute by asking questions and making comments on the course website. Some of my colleagues in the Princeton sociology department have agreed to join us for these sessions. A midterm examination will be available as will a final examination. These exams will consist of a combination of identification questions and short essay questions.
FAQ

In this course you will learn how to create societal impact through Social Entrepreneurship (S-ENT). S-ENT describes the discovery and sustainable exploitation of opportunities to create social change. The course introduces you to practical S-ENT examples as well as the foundational literature.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
The domain of social change is no longer reserved for students of political sciences and development studies. Increasingly business students are recognized as possessing important skills that can drive social change. This new discipline is often referred to as Social Entrepreneurship (S-ENT). S-ENT describes the discovery and sustainable exploitation of opportunities to create public goods. This is usually done through the generation of disequilibria in market and non-market environments. The S-ENT process can in some cases lead to the creation of social enterprises. These social ventures are hybrid organizations exhibiting characteristics of both the for-profit and not-for-profit sector. Individuals engaging in S-ENT are usually referred to as social entrepreneurs, a term that describes resourceful individuals working to create social innovation. They do not only have to identify (or create) opportunities for social change (that so far have been unexploited), they must also muster the resources necessary to turn these opportunities into reality. 

A typical example is Prof. Muhammad Yunus, founder of the Grameen Bank (Bangladesh) and recipient of the Nobel Peace prize in recognition of his contribution to poverty alleviation through the invention and popularization of Microfinance. Other examples include fair trade or car-sharing. Today many foundations aim to identify and promote social entrepreneurs. Two prominent examples are Ashoka and the Skoll Foundation. So called venture philanthropists adopt methods from the domain of venture capital, for example, encouraging social entrepreneurs to provide detailed business plans and to measure and report systematically on their social performance. Social Return on Investment (S-ROI) analysis is an example, of an emerging tool aiming to describe the social impact of S-ENT in dollar terms, relative to the philanthropic investment made.

	<field name="course_intro">Social Epidemiology
Social epidemiology is about how a society makes people sick and/or healthy. We address not only the identification of new disease risk factors (e.g., deficient social capital) but also how well-known exposures (e.g., cigarette smoking, lead paint, health insurance) emerge and are maintained by the social system.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This course is about understanding the determinants of health from a broad perspective. We focus on how social relationships and institutions -- such as familial relationships, national policies, and global economic forces -- promote or undermine the health of populations. The course covers existing evidence of health disparities, research methods, and theories relevant to the topic. 

The course is interesting because it reveals the so-called fundamental causes of disease and health disparities recognizable within social groups. For example, we examine why a flu germ can affect whole groups of people differently. In short, the course challenges the notion that health is a narrowly defined medical problem. 

Students in the course will listen to lectures, read provided materials, and complete quizzes and tests that examine comprehension and one&#39;s ability to synthesize ideas. 

Upon completion of the course students should:
have a deep appreciation for how social arrangements impact the health of populations,
be able to critically evaluate the scientific and popular health literature that address the causes of disease,
be able to measure key social drivers such as race and socioeconomic status, and 
be able to conceive of research strategies that can answer questions critical for policy making.
Course Syllabus
Week 1:  Background and History 
What is social epidemiology and where did it come from? What is different about it? 

Week 2: Issues 
What are the fundamental issues (e.g., environment, race, genetics) in/for social epidemiology? 

Week 3: Health Disparities  
How can social epidemiology improve our understanding of the identification and analysis of, if not remedies for, health disparities? 

Week 4: Theories and Constructs 
What theories and/or constructs are fundamental to social epidemiology? 

Week 5: Measurement 
What are some fundamental measurement issues in social epidemiology? 

Week 6: Design &amp; Inference 
What are some fundamental design and analysis tools in social epidemiology? 

Week 7: Doing Things 
What social epidemiological interventions work and fail, and why? 
Recommended Background
Students should be curious, enthusiastic readers, with undergraduate-level analytical and critical thinking skills; and have an interest in policy implications surrounding social and societal health issues. A basic understanding of statistics would also be useful.  
Course Format
The class will consist of 7 lectures, one per week. Each lecture will be made up of 2-4 video modules or parts. Each of the video modules will be about 8-12 minutes in length. 

Most of the video modules (i.e., parts of the lectures) will have a mini quiz of one or two multiple choice questions. There will also be standalone readings and (group) homework assignments that are not part of video lectures. Additionally, there will be an overall lecture quiz for each of the seven lectures. This overall quiz will have approximately 10 multiple choice questions in it. There will not be a final exam.

Coursera&#39;s largest class is back by popular demand!

Scheduled to begin July 14, 2014, Social Psychology will feature a fresh line-up of special events, guest experts, and material intended to delight psychology lovers around the world. 

Course Description from Professor Plous:

Each of us is dealt a different hand in life, but we all face similar questions when it comes to human behavior: What leads us to like one person and dislike another? How do conflicts and prejudices develop, and how can they be reduced? Can psychological research help protect the environment, and if so, how? This course offers an introduction to classic and contemporary social psychology, covering topics such as decision making, persuasion, group behavior, personal attraction, and factors that promote health and well-being.

Our focus will be on surprising, entertaining, and intriguing research findings that are easy to apply in daily life. As part of this focus, several homework assignments will encourage you to experiment with your life, observe the results, and analyze what took place. The course will also draw from the web sites of Social Psychology Network, the world&#39;s largest online community devoted to social psychology. I hope you&#39;ll join me for this course, have fun, and learn some useful information that enriches your life!    

Recommended Background
No background is required; all are welcome!

Part of the &quot;Cybersecurity&quot; Specialization »
In this course we will look at how to build software that is secure. At the conclusion of the course, the student will know how to &quot;build security in&quot; rather than consider it as an afterthought, and will have a plethora of skills, applicable at each phase of the development cycle, that can be used to strengthen the security of software systems.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Software is everywhere: in laptops and desktops, mobile phones, the power grid ... even our cars and thermostats. Software is increasingly the vehicle that drives our economy and our personal lives. But software’s pervasiveness, and its importance, make it a target: at the root of many security compromises is vulnerable software.

In this course we will look at how to build software that is secure.

We will see that security must appear at all phases in the development lifecycle, including requirements development, system design, implementation, testing/validation, and maintenance. To start, we will consider tasks and methods that enhance a software system&#39;s design, including threat modeling and attack surface reduction.

Then we will examine the most prevalent software implementation flaws. At the root of many of these flaws is a failure to mute the influence of untrusted information, and a failure to restrict the flow of private information. We will examine flaws like buffer overruns and double-free&#39;s that are present in programs written in low-level programming languages like C and C++. We will also examine flaws, like data races and improper randomness, that can arise in software written any language. Finally, we will look at flaws like SQL injection and cross-site scripting that are notable for their presence in web and mobile applications. Having examined these flaws and their role in security compromises, we will look at steps you can take to fix them, both at the design and the implementation level.

Finally, we will look at state-of-the-art tools and techniques for testing and otherwise verifying that software is secure. We will consider how security testing differs from functional testing (it&#39;s harder!). We will look at the art of penetration testing, which is the activity of trying to find and exploit weaknesses in a system prior to its deployment. We will also look at an emerging class of program analysis tools that can automatically identify flaws in programs, either by analyzing their code or by monitoring their execution.

At the conclusion of the course, the student will know how to &quot;build security in&quot; rather than consider it as an afterthought, and will have a plethora of skills, applicable at each phase of the development cycle, that can be used to strengthen the security of software systems.


Course Syllabus
The following topics will be covered, though not necessarily in equal depth; the first topics are likely to be about ¼ of the time, while the last two for the remaining ¾ with the secure coding topic problem being the majority of that.

Secure software design principles and process
How security fits in the development lifecycle, from requirements to support/maintenance

Threat modeling and impact on the design and code

Principles of secure code design

-- E.g., defense in depth, least privilege, small/simple trusted computing base, secure failures, secure defaults

Attack surface, and reducing it

Secure coding, including the following topics:
Idea: information and data flow, and application to input validation and privacy protection

Flaws and their remediation: Buffer overruns, integer arithmetic errors, cross-site scripting, SQL injection, race conditions, bad randomness, information exposure

Security testing, and auditing, including the following topics:
Differences between security testing and functional testing

Fuzz testing and other penetration testing techniques

Static and dynamic analysis methods/tools</field>

Learn an efficient, effective process for writing songs that express your ideas and emotions, including a range of tools that revolve around the concept of prosody—the matching of lyrics and music to support your underlying message.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
There’s a songwriter lurking somewhere inside you, peeking around corners, wondering if it’s safe to come out. Now it is. This course is an invitation to let your inner songwriter step into the sunlight. All it takes is a simple “yes” and you’ll be climbing that windy hill, marveling at the view.

If you haven’t written any or many songs, this course will show you an efficient, effective process for tailoring songs to express your ideas and emotions. If you have, you’ll look at your process differently, taking control of aspects of the process you may have not noticed.

The course will start by examining the tools available to you, all revolving around the essential concept of prosody. You’ll learn to use your tools to enhance your message—to work compositionally at the same time you’re developing your ideas.

You’ll be working both lyrically and musically, though musically it’s not necessary that you either read music or play an instrument. If you play, great, and you’ll be encouraged to play and record your musical responses to the assignments. If you don’t play, the course offers you a number of musical loops to work with. All you’ll have to do is sing your melodies over the loops.

Assignments will ask you to post something for peer review—sometimes lyric lines or sections, sometimes melodies, sometimes both. None of it has to be polished. The course is about writing, not performing.

Most important, you’ll have a lot of fun.

By the end of this lesson, you will see how to develop your song idea so it creates an interesting journey from start to finish. You’ll understand your options developing the point of view of your song and will be introduced to the songwriter’s six best friends.
Lesson 2: Stopping and Going

By the end of this lesson, you will understand the concept of prosody as it relates to the number of lines/musical phrases in a section and to line lengths/musical phrases, the school crossing guards of your song. You’ll create both stable and unstable line/musical groupings, using an odd or even number of lines and musical phrases. Using these tools, you’ll write a verse and chorus.
Lesson 3: Sonic GPS—Mapping Your Song with Rhyme

By the end of this lesson, you will understand the relationship of rhyme schemes to prosody. You’ll create both stable and unstable sections, using various rhyme schemes to show your ear the way to go home. Using these tools, you’ll write a new verse and chorus.
Lesson 4: Making It Move

By the end of this lesson, you will understand language rhythms—the difference between stressed and unstressed syllables and how to put rhythm in your lines, preparing them to join into the dance with musical rhythm. Using these tools, you’ll put last week’s verse and chorus to music.
Lesson 5: Writing the Song

In this lesson, you’ll select a new song title and create a worksheet to help develop your ideas. You’ll write your lyric and set it to music, matching your lyric rhythms to melodic rhythms. You’ll create a melody, using stable and unstable notes to support your ideas.
Lesson 6: Crossing the Finished Line

By the end of this lesson, you will understand the role of phrasing to create the body language of your song, using the relationship of your phrases to musical downbeats to create stability or instability. Then you’ll put the finishing touches on your song from lesson 5.
Recommended Background
No prior songwriting or musical experience is necessary.

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Throughout history, the vast majority of people around the globe have believed they have, however defined, a “soul.” While the question of whether the soul exists cannot be answered by science, what we can study are the causes and consequences of various beliefs about the soul and its prospects of surviving the death of the body. Why are soul and afterlife beliefs so common in human history? Are there adaptive advantages to assuming souls exist?  Are there brain structures that have been shaped by environmental pressures that provide the foundation of body/mind dualism that is such a prominent feature of many religions? How do these beliefs shape the worldviews of different cultures and our collective lives? What is the role of competing afterlife beliefs in religion, science, politics, and war? This course explores several facets of this relatively unexplored but profoundly important aspect of human thought and behavior.

Recommended Background
For thousands of years, people have believed that they are endowed with souls and that their souls will survive the death of their bodies.  It is surprising that this common denominator of most religions has operated in the shadows of public discussions. Up to now it has been one of those elephants in the room that nobody talks about.  This course breaks that tradition and, in doing so, opens the doors to the fertile fields of many disciplines that inform us about the durability of soul and afterlife beliefs.  Originally taught as an undergraduate &quot;general education&quot; course at Rutgers University, it has attracted the attention of adults of all ages and many occupations who like to think deeply about matters that pertain to how we function as human beings. 
In sum, no background is required; all are welcome.  
Suggested Readings

Course Format
The course consists mainly of 70- to 80-minute lectures typically broken up into 3 segments, recorded from a Signature Course offered by Rutgers University School of Arts and Sciences in the Fall-2012 semester.  These lectures include PowerPoint slides and some embedded video clips. 

Each lecture has a recommended supporting reading assignment which may provide additional opportunities to reflect on your studies.</field>

This course introduces concepts, algorithms, programming, theory and design of spatial computing technologies such as global positioning systems (GPS), Google Maps, location-based services and geographic information systems. Learn how to collect, analyze, and visualize your own spatial datasets while avoiding common pitfalls and building better location-aware technologies.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
From Google Maps to consumer global positioning system (GPS) devices, spatial technology shapes many lives in both ordinary and extraordinary ways. Thanks to spatial computing, a hiker in Yellowstone and a taxi driver in Manhattan can know precisely where they are, discover nearby points of interest and learn how to reach their destinations. Spatial computing technology is what powers the Foursquare check-in, the maps app on your smartphone, the devices used by scientists to track endangered species, the routing directions that help you get from point A to point B, the precision agriculture technology that is revolutionizing farming, and the augmented reality devices like Google Glass that may soon mediate our interaction with the real world.

This course introduces the fundamental ideas underlying spatial computing services, systems, and sciences. Topics covered will include the nature of geospatial information, proper statistical frameworks for working with geospatial data, key algorithms and data structures, spatial data mining, and cartography/geovisualization. We will also address applied topics such as where to find spatial data, how to use powerful open source software to analyze and map spatial data, and frameworks for building location-based services. 

Three Ways to Enjoy this Course: 
This course is designed to support three different types of students and educational goals: 
Curiosity Track: Most of us interact with spatial technologies every day. This track is for students who wish to learn about one or two spatial computing topics, but not commit to an entire course. Curiosity track students are not interested in a certificate of accomplishment. 
Concepts Track: This track is for students who want to learn about spatial computing concepts in order to make informed choices, but who are not programmers and do not have extensive experience with statistical methods. For example, concepts track students will learn about Tobler’s First Law of geography and map projections, but will not delve into the quantifications of either. Students who complete the concepts track with sufficiently high scores will receive a Statement of Accomplishment. 
Technical Track: This track builds on the concepts track, but adds math and programming. For example, we will cover spatial statistical indicators like Moran’s I and Ripley’s K when discussing Tobler’s First Law and will have students calculate the distance between two points using two different coordinate systems and open-source APIs. Students who complete the technical track with sufficiently high scores will receive a Distinguished Statement of Accomplishment. 
Course Format
Students in this course will learn through topical lectures as well as interviews with and guest lectures from academic and industry experts.</field>

Have we reached the boundaries of what can be achieved in sports and building design? The answer is definitely “NO”. This course explains basic aspects of bluff body aerodynamics, wind tunnel testing and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations with application to sports and building aerodynamics. It is intended for anyone with a strong interest in these topics. Key fields addressed are urban physics, wind engineering and sports engineering.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Can the present outstanding records in cycling team time trials be further improved? Can the present world and Olympic records in athletics disciplines such as the 100 m sprint be advanced? This course provides the answer to these questions. It shows that aerodynamic processes in sports and around buildings are very complex and that many misconceptions exist. These misconceptions are caused by the often counter-intuitive flow physics. Interestingly, the same counter-intuitive flow physics govern the misconceptions in both sports and building aerodynamics. The insights from this course will help you to understand and improve the performance of top athletes and of modern building design. 

In 2013, team Orica-Green Edge set the fastest-ever average speed for a Tour de France team time trial, with 57.8 km/h over a distance of 25 km, beating team Omega-Pharma Quick-Step by a mere 0.75 s. At the subsequent 2013 UCI Road World Championships, the latter team beat the former by only 0.88 s. Clearly, even minor aerodynamic improvements can be decisive in these prestigious races. And, surprisingly, up to now, the optimum aerodynamic setting for a team time trial has not yet been explored.

Records in athletics races such as the 100 m sprint, the 110 m hurdles and the long jump are only validated by the IAAF (International Association of Athletics Federations) when the tail wind does not exceed 2 m/s. Most world and Olympic records have been established at tail winds close to 2 m/s. Clearly, local aerodynamic effects can be decisive in establishing new records. Also here, the optimum aerodynamic setting has not yet been explored.

New and prestigious building projects are realized in different parts of the world. Some of them feature the integration of wind energy systems in the building design. Also here, aerodynamic misconceptions can lead to suboptimal performance.

The course starts with a brief recapitulation of the basic aspects of fluid flow: statics, kinematics, dynamics, flow regimes and boundary layers, including the atmospheric boundary layer in which sports and building aerodynamics take place. Next, the main aspects of the aerodynamic analysis techniques of wind tunnel testing and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are outlined. Tips and tricks for wind tunnel testing and CFD simulations are given. This knowledge provides the basis for the course parts on building aerodynamics, 100 m sprint aerodynamics and cycling aerodynamics, where some surprising and sometimes spectacular results will be shown.

Recommended Background
The first three parts of this course assume an overall high-school level knowledge of mathematics and physics (fluid mechanics), although a more advanced level of mathematics is recommended for the parts on the approximate forms of the governing equations of fluid flow. However, this should not deter other participants from following the course.

The last three parts of the course assume a lower degree of scientific knowledge and are geared toward a more general audience. These parts are explicitly intended at the widest possible audience. Again, the full benefit from the course will be obtained by participants with a background in mathematics and physics (fluid mechanics).

Suggested Readings
We have developed the course to be to a very large degree self-contained.

Course Format
The course consists of 6 weeks. Every week consists of a series of short lecture videos (called modules) of about 8-15 minutes each. Every modules will start with a short question that will be answered later in the module based on the newly acquired knowledge. 
Reading assignments are provided for every week.
Forum discussions.
Main assignment which is an evaluation of a published scientific paper on wind-tunnel testing and/or CFD for Sports and/or Building Aerodynamics.
Final exam (multiple choice, online).
FAQ
Will I earn a Statement of Accomplishment for this course?
Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.

What resources will I need for this class?
A computer, a good internet connection, the reading material that we will provide and your curiosity. 

Do I need a scientific background?
The MOOC consists of 6 weeks. The first 3 weeks focus on the &quot;fundamentals&quot;, however always with clear links to the applications (Sports &amp; Building Aerodynamics). The last 3 weeks focus on the &quot;applications&quot;. We built the MOOC in this way because the knowledge of the fundamentals is important to fully understand the applications. In terms of university/academic education, both &quot;fundamentals&quot; and &quot;applications&quot; are essential components of a course and therefore also the assignments will focus on these two  components.

So we recommend following all 6 weeks in order to obtain the largest benefit from this MOOC. This being said, for a general audience we can imagine that their interest lies in the last 3 weeks with applications. It is possible to follow these 3 weeks without the detailed knowledge of the fundamentals and still learn quite a lot from it. 

Concerning the Statement of Accomplishment, this includes all 6 weeks and there will be two tracks: 
(1) the &quot;basic&quot; track, with assignments that are to be completed by anyone who wants to earn the Statement of Accomplishment.
(2) the &quot;advanced&quot; track, that consists of the assignments in the basic track supplemented with additional (more advanced) assignments. This will give you the &quot;advanced&quot; Statement of Accomplishment.

What are the learning outcomes of this course and why should I take it?  

By following this course you will learn more about:

How wind tunnel testing is performed, and what are the most important quality issues.
What Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are about.
How CFD simulations are performed, and what are the most important quality issues.
How wind flows around buildings and what problems this entails.
What pedestrian-level wind discomfort is about, and how it can be avoided.
Whether the venturi-effect is present between buildings, and why or why not.
How misconceptions about fluid flow can affect the performance of wind energy systems integrated in buildings and/or built environments.
How insights in building aerodynamics can be used to provide better building designs.
How wind flow affects sprinting times. How temperature and altitude affect sprinting times. How head or tail winds should be measured.
How wind tunnel testing and CFD can be used to analyze sprinting times.
How wind flow affects cycling speed. How temperature and altitude affect cycling times. How drafting affects aerodynamic resistance.
How wind tunnel testing and CFD can be used to analyze cycling aerodynamics.
How insights in sport aerodynamics can be used to yield better performances.
What’s the coolest thing about this course?
You will never look at sports and buildings in the same way again.

How do I ask questions?
There will be an on-line discussion forum in which students can ask questions and receive answers. While the scale of an on-line class means that often the fastest (and best!) answer comes from another student, the course staff will monitor the discussions for accuracy and to address questions where the student community particularly wants to hear from the staff.

Why do you offer this course for free?
Eindhoven University of Technology is a young and very ambitious technical university that wants to expand its international profile and communicate some of its many core expertise areas to the rest of the world. We are committed to providing students the space for obtaining a thorough and multifaceted education. This MOOC offers us the possibility to share our knowledge globally.</field>

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Sports play a giant role in contemporary society worldwide. But few of us pause to think about the larger questions of money, politics, race, sex, culture, and commercialization that surround sports everywhere. This course draws on the tools of anthropology, sociology, history, and other disciplines to give you new perspectives on the games we watch and play. We will focus on both popular sports like soccer (or “football,” as anyone outside America calls it), basketball, and baseball, and also lesser-known ones like mountain-climbing and fishing. The course features special guest lectures about the Olympics, skateboarding, and the Afro-Brazilian martial art of capoeira.  We will also have Google Hangouts with several prominent figures from the sports and sports studies world (guests last time the course was offered included former major league baseball player and ESPN commentator Doug Glanville; the German soccer star and gay rights spokesperson Thomas Hitzlsperger; and leading sports journalist Selena Roberts). You will never watch or think about sports in the same way again.

***If you&#39;d like to watch a sample lecture to get a better idea of the class, you can do so by clicking here.  This one is about sports videos games and their explosively growing popularity, and a little unusual in that it was filmed at Professor Starn&#39;s house near the Duke University campus.  All the lectures, as this one does, features a list of keywords that are introduced near the lecture&#39;s beginning and defined over its course.
Course Syllabus
Week One: Introduction to key concepts in sports studies, including the distinctions between play, games, and sports; examination of the 19th century rise of organized professional sports.  Case study focus on the Afro-Brazilian martial art of capoeira.

Week Two: exploration of the globalization of sports, and the relationship between sports and politics, nationalism, and social protest.  Case study focus on the rise of South American soccer, originally imported from England in the 19th century; Hitler’s 1936 Berlin Olympics; and the Black Power Protest at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics.

Week Three: race and race relations in sports, including the history of African Americans in sports and new Asian sports stars.  Case study of golf superstar Tiger Woods.

Week Four: gender and sexuality; how sports have been linked to idea of male prowess, and, more recently, the rise of women’s sports; the question of homophobia and its continuing presence in the sports world.  Case study focus on women’s figure-skating and the American NFL.

Week Five: sports fans and sports performance. Examines the question of why so many of us spend so much time watching and going to games, including the role of aesthetics and beauty in sports. Case study focus on the debate about big-time American college sports. 

Week Six: the business of sports; considers the enormous growth of the multibillion dollar business of sports, including video games, apparel, licensing, and other forces.  Case study focus on sports apparel megacompany Nike and the vast new popularity of sports videogames.

How do you build relationships with Elementary Grade (K-6) students, establish and maintain behavioral expectations, implement classroom procedures and routines, and use instructional time effectively?</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Developing mastery in establishing and maintaining a rich learning environment is one of the great joys of being a teacher. This course will provide high leverage strategies, resources, and support for professional growth so that you can provide students with the engaging, safe environment essential for student learning. This course is aligned to the needs of Elementary Grade teachers (self-contained K-6, or teaching the same set of students usually under 12 years old).

This course will teach you how to implement research-based strategies in the following areas : 
Setting and communicating high expectations for students;
Building positive relationships with and between students;
Organizing the learning environment;
Behavioral preventions and interventions; and
Establishing and maintaining routines and procedures that support student learning.
Stellar classrooms don’t just happen—they’re created with the kind of intentional planning and preparation this course offers so that you and your students can be successful from the start!
Course Syllabus
The course is designed for you to engage with two modules per week, submit two peer assessment projects and then assess your peers’ work. We also know that the start of school varies across the country so we have opened up all of the content and if necessary you can watch the module videos and participate in the discussions at your own pace. 
Recommended Background
Actively teaching, preparing to teach, or interested in teaching in the Primary Grades (self-contained K-6).
Course Format
The class will consist of videos and discussion posts.  Participants will be expected to respond to instructor and peer discussion posts. Assignments will be classroom based and will be assessed by peers according to provided rubrics.  An end-of-course reflection and survey are required for completion. This course will be conducted in English.


FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.

What resources will I need for this class?
For this course, all you need is an Internet connection, and the time to read, write, discuss, and learn about becoming a successful beginning teacher. You should be planning to teach students this year.

I am not sure if I should enroll here, or should enroll in the other course aligned with Secondary Grades. Which course will work best for me?
If you teach in a self-contained classroom, usually in Elementary School (K-5 or K-6), where you teach all subjects to the same set of students, usually under 12 years old, then this is your course! But if you teach in a  department based classroom, (teaching sections of math, science, language arts, PE, fine arts, etc.) usually in Middle or High School then you should enroll in First Year Teaching (Secondary Grades) - Success from the Start</field>

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Statistical inference is the process of drawing conclusions about populations or scientific truths from data. There are many modes of performing inference including statistical modeling, data oriented strategies and explicit use of designs and randomization in analyses. Furthermore, there are broad theories (frequentists, Bayesian, likelihood, design based, …) and numerous complexities (missing data, observed and unobserved confounding, biases) for performing inference. A practitioner can often be left in a debilitating maze of techniques, philosophies and nuance. This course presents the fundamentals of inference in a practical approach for getting things done. After taking this course, students will understand the broad directions of statistical inference and use this information for making informed choices in analyzing data.
Course Syllabus
In this class students will learn the fundamentals of statistical inference. Students will receive a broad overview of the goals, assumptions and modes of performing statistical inference. Students will be able to perform inferential tasks in highly targeted settings and will be able to use  the skills developed as a roadmap for more complex inferential challenges.

Suggested Readings
Lectures are designed to be self-contained, but we recommend that students refer to the book OpenIntro Statistics (Second Edition). The course will closely follow this book, and hence the text can serve as supplementary material to the videos. In addition, practice problems will be assigned from the book. The book is open-source and freely available online at openintro.org.




Course Format
The class will include video lectures, between 5 and 10 minutes in length, containing a few quiz questions per video. There will be homework assignments consisting of graded multiple choice quizzes and optional, ungraded questions from the textbook, computational data analysis assignments, a data analysis project, a midterm, and a final exam.

FAQ
Will I get a Certificate after completing this class? 
Yes, if you successfully complete the class according to the grading policy. 

Is this course free?
Yes! You can take this course for free, and you can earn a certificate for free. 

However there is a charge if you would like a verified certificate. You can read more about the verified certificate here, and decide if this is something you are interested in. In addition, if you would like a Specialization Certificate in Reasoning, Data Analysis and Writing, you will need a verified certificate. You can read more about the Specialization here.

Do I need prior programming knowledge to take this course?  
No programming background is required. Everything you need to know will be covered in the course.  

What resources will I need for this class?
You will need a stable internet connection in order to watch the videos, access the suggested readings, take the quizzes and tests. To complete the labs and the capstone project, you will need to run R (a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics) and RStudio (an integrated development environment that serves as a user interface for R). 

Alternatively, you will have the option of completing the labs (though not the project) on DataCamp.com, an online interactive learning platform. The platform hosts interactive versions of the R labs used in this course, and it provides you with hints and instant feedback that should facilitate the learning process. The hints are like having a tutor with you, and the instant feedback helps avoid much of the frustration associated with learning a new programming language and deciphering cryptic error messages.

Can R/RStudio run on any system? 
R is available for Windows, Mac OS, and Ubuntu.  You can download R at http://www.r-project.org, and RStudio at http://www.rstudio.com/. Once the course begins we will post videos on installing and getting started with R and RStudio.

Do I have to learn R to complete this course?
While you can navigate through some of the course material without using R, you will need R for the labs and the capstone project to be eligible for a Certificate with Distinction.

Can R run on smartphone or a tablet?  
It is possible to run R on a smartphone or a tablet (see here), but this will require access to a working install of RStudio server, which we will not be providing or supporting for this course. Instructions for installing RStudio server are available at the RStudio website here.</field>

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
In this data centric era, statistics has become an essential tool for processing information from the realm of public health and medical research.  Understanding both the implications and limitations of the results from such research is essential for making informed treatment decisions, public health practice protocols and policy recommendations.  In this class, a conceptual and interpretive approach is applied to some of the most used methods from basic statistics.  The course will detail appropriate summary measures for quantifying the health of single populations, and comparing such outcomes between populations using results from representative but imperfect data samples.  Additionally, the role of uncertainty in sample based estimated will be covered, allowing for conclusions to be drawn regarding the larger populations under study while recognizing the imperfection in the study estimates.  All topics will be considered through a “conceptual lens” allowing students to focus on the “what”, “why”, and “so what” with regards to the implications of research results.

Course Syllabus
study designs for comparing populations
single sample numerical summary measures for continuous, binary and time-to-event outcomes
visual displays for continuous and time-to-event outcomes
the normal (Gaussian) distribution
measures of association: mean differences, risk differences, relative risks, odds ratios and incidence rate ratios
confidence intervals for means, mean differences, proportions, relative risks, odds ratios, incidence rates and incidence rate ratios
hypothesis testing: paired and two-sample t-tests, the chi-square test, Fisher&#39;s exact test, and the log-rank test
power and sample size  (optional)
Course Format
Students will view video lectures and demonstrate their progress by completing quizzes and homework assignments.

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Statistics One is designed to be a comprehensive yet friendly introduction to fundamental concepts in statistics. Comprehensive means that this course provides a solid foundation for students planning to pursue more advanced courses in statistics. Friendly means exactly that. The course assumes very little background knowledge in statistics and introduces new concepts with several fun and easy to understand examples. 

This course is, quite literally, for everyone. If you think you can&#39;t learn statistics, this course is for you. If you had a statistics course before but feel like you need a refresher, this course is for you. Even if you are a relatively advanced researcher or analyst, this course provides a foundation and a context that helps to put one’s work into perspective.

Statistics One also provides an introduction to the R programming language. All the examples and assignments will involve writing code in R and interpreting R output. R software is free! What this means is you can download R, take this course, and start programming in R after just a few lectures. That said, this course is not a comprehensive guide to R or to programming in general.

Learn how markets work, what they accomplish well and what their limitations are.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
We make economics decisions every day: what to buy, whether to work or play, what to study. We respond to markets all the time: prices influence our decisions, markets signal where to put effort, they direct firms to produce certain goods over others. Economics is all around us. 

This course is a rigorous introduction to the microeconomic theory of markets: why we have them, how they work, what they accomplish. We will explore what outcomes they generate when they work well and what happens when they do not. We will learn why governments are important and when regulation and intervention is necessary. Examples are taken from everyday life, from goods and services that we all purchase and use. We will apply the theory to current events and policy debates through weekly exercises. These will empower you to be an educated, critical thinker who can understand, analyze and evaluate market outcomes.


Course Syllabus
Week One: Where do markets come from? We will start with understanding the constraint of scarcity that we face and the concept of opportunity cost that reflects the true cost of any decision we make.

Week Two: We will discuss how gains from specialization according to our comparative advantage allows us to use our resources efficiently. We will apply these concepts to a simple model of trade.

Week Three: We will introduce the basic model of Supply &amp; Demand. This will allow you to communicate with other economists and finally understand those business pages and market updates. 

Week Four: There is a lot of terminology this week. We will introduce of the concept of elasticity to discuss effects of price and income changes on market outcomes.Then we will explore the great accomplishment of markets: maximizing the size of the pie or the total benefit to society.

Week Five: What happens when government intervenes in the market? We will analyze price floors and ceilings, taxes and subsidies and learn how the best intentions sometimes lead to very unfortunate results.

Week Six: Introduction to firms’ decisions: understanding firms’ cost curves and the goal of profit maximization.

Week Seven: The Perfectly Competitive Market: what is it? does it exist? why is it a crucial benchmark?

Week Eight: Monopolies of various types: one price monopoly, natural monopoly, price discrimination and monopolistic competition. What market outcomes do we get in each case? How should government intervene in such cases?

Week Nine: Understanding the market for labor. Defining employment and unemployment. We will learn about the minimum wage and the concerns economist have with setting it too high. We will also learn of cases were minimum wage makes sense

Week Ten: When markets fail: externalities and public good. We will cover the classical approach to these topics as well as introduce a few simple concepts from Game Theory to understand the Tragedy of the Commons.

Week Eleven: Poverty and inequality: how do we measure these? How do we balance our concern about poverty and inequality while allowing markets to work for the benefit of society at large?   


Recommended Background
Economics requires thinking in three “languages”: words, graph and mathematical notation. All concepts are introduced slowly and gradually, but comfort with thinking analytically will be helpful.

Suggested Readings
There are many wonderful introductory texts to Microeconomics that you could use to supplement the Coursera material. At the University of Pennsylvania I have been using Michael Parkin’s “ Principles of Microeconomics” as I find it especially rigorous and accurate. You are welcome to use any basic text or none at all.

I do recommend reading economic newspapers and popular books on the topic. My favorite is The Economist, especially the Business and the Finance and Economics sections. This course will help your fluency in understanding such material.


Course Format
The class will consist of lecture videos which are between 8 and 15 minutes long. Each video will include integrated questions to help you assess your comprehension.

There are weekly assignments. Each week there will be a 10 question multiple choice assessment. We will also have six extended assignments in the course that require applying the model, our graphs and numerical examples to analyze an example based on recent news article. Three of these assignments will be auto graded and three will be peer assessments.

There is a final exam. You will have two weeks to complete it.


FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Science and technology continue to play an increasingly central role in our lives, not least in countries such as China that are undergoing rapid technological, economic and social change. This course is the first of a trilogy of short courses on science, technology, and society in China. Here, we explore in general terms how engineering as well as scientific knowledge and practice are influenced by dynamic interactions between science, technology, innovation, and society. The course will introduce the innovation systems approach, laying the groundwork for mastering the remaining two parts of the course by introducing broad concepts and ideas to provide students with a platform on which to think about the science/technology–society relationship and related policy issues with a focus on China. This understanding will then be applied more specifically to China in the next two courses in the series. Part II will examine the impact of the Industrial Revolution in the West on scientific and technological progress in China. Part III will examine science and technology in Chinese society today and the basis for the policy prescriptions the Chinese government is currently employing to promote innovation and technology development.

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Having mastered in general terms some of the key concepts used in understanding the relationship between science/technology and society, this course begins to apply those concepts to China, historically and chronologically. Concepts such as path dependency/lock-in effect, technological determinism and others will be used to frame a narrative describing the emergence of science and technology in Chinese society. This narrative will be heavily informed by developments in the West during the Industrial Revolution so that we can understand how that series of events affected the development of science and technology in China. This part of the course will also lay the foundation for Part III.

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This course provides an introduction to the interdisciplinary field of sustainable development, drawing on the most recent developments in the social, policy, and physical sciences. Sustainable development is the most urgent challenge facing humanity. The fundamental question is how the world economy can continue to develop in a way that is socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable. The course describes the complex interactions between the world economy and the Earth&#39;s physical environment. Ecological processes and constraints (climate, disease ecology, physical resources such as soils and energy sources, topography and transport conditions) significantly shape the patterns of economic development, demography, and wealth and poverty. At the same time, human activities (farming, land use, urbanization, demographic change, and energy use) change the physical environments, increasingly in dangerous ways. The course offers a broad overview of the key challenges and potential solutions to achieve sustainable development in the 21st century.

Course Format
Course Engagement

Since this course is a massive open online course (MOOC), we will not be able to respond to each individual question. We will be answering questions and holding discussion through two forums:

 1)    Course discussion forums: Please check the discussion forums frequently to ask questions and hold discussions with the course staff, including Professor Sachs, and with your fellow students. The boards will include discussions of the weekly material and quizzes; and on the “join the conversation” board we will be posting weekly questions and prompts, and discussing relevant current events.

 2)   Google Hangouts: Each week the course staff will hold 4 google hangouts to answer student questions and discuss relevant topics – anyone will be able to participate and submit their questions. The times of these hangouts will vary in order to accommodate as many students as possible; however, if you have to miss a hangout, you will be able to watch the video at a later time. The hangouts will be conducted in English, Spanish, French, Chinese, and Hindi. Professor Sachs will be holding hangouts approximately every 2 weeks. All hangout times will be announced in advanced.

 Meetups: Many students in the Coursera community organize in-person meetups to discuss the class. Interested students can find each other on the &quot;Join a Meetup&quot; tab.



Weekly Materials Provided

“The Age of Sustainable Development” will run for 14 weeks, beginning on January 21, 2014. New materials will be posted every Tuesday. Once a week’s material has been posted, it will stay up for the duration of the course.

The weekly lecture materials provided will be:

1)    Course videos: Each week’s lecture will have 5 video “chapters,” posted under “Video Lectures.” The videos will contain 2-3 in-line questions, which are multiple choice questions that pop up during the video. 

2)   Assigned reading: Each week there will be assigned reading materials, all of which will be free links. The readings will include accompanying course material written by Prof. Sachs, which will also go up weekly. 

 

Quizzes/Assignments
1) There are 14 quizzes (10-15 questions long) that correspond to the 14 weekly lecture topics. Each week, a new quiz will be posted under the “Quizzes” tab. All quizzes are due within 3 weeks of the posting date, and each quiz can be taken up to 10 times.

2) Each video will have an in-line quiz (2-3 multiple choice questions) that is not counted for a grade.

3) In the last week of the course, one final assignment will be available that covers all the course material.  


Grading Policy
The best 13 out of 14 quizzes will account for 60% of the final grade. The final assignment accounts for 40% of the final grade. In-line video questions are not included in the grade calculations.

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This course introduces the academic approach of Sustainability and explores how today’s human societies can endure in the face of global change, ecosystem degradation and resource limitations. The course focuses on key knowledge areas of sustainability theory and practice, including population, ecosystems, global change, energy, agriculture, water, environmental economics and policy, ethics, and cultural history.

This subject is of vital importance, seeking as it does to uncover the principles of the long-term welfare of all the peoples of the planet. As sustainability is a cross-disciplinary field of study, this foundation requires intellectual breadth: as I describe it in the class text, understanding our motivations requires the humanities, measuring the challenges of sustainability requires knowledge of the sciences (both natural and social), and building solutions requires technical insight into systems (such as provided by engineering, planning, and management).

Learn about the impact of infectious disease on sustainable animal-based food production by understanding the science of growth, immunity, and infection and by learning the problem-solving skills needed to advance animal health and food production through optimal management practices.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
There is a growing global need in agricultural production for a workforce that is capable of integrating knowledge of animal health and production with an understanding of consumer preferences in the context of economic reality, business efficiency, and ethical constraint.  However, current evidence suggests that there is a growing shortage of people with the knowledge and problem-solving skills required to match the rapid advances being made in animal health, science, and food production.  The results of this shortage are wide-ranging and could lead to challenges in food security and agricultural economic competitiveness in some countries.

In this course we will explore the effect of infectious disease on sustainable animal-based food production. The content and learning outcomes of this new course will be designed to be relevant across different food production sectors (i.e., beef, dairy, poultry, and pigs). While the instructors will provide the participants with a strong scientific base for understanding the impact of infectious disease in animal-based food production, the emphasis of the material will be on practical problem-solving and will be directed towards equipping participants with a platform for developing the skills needed to contribute to sustainable food production.

Course Syllabus
Week 1: How does livestock disease impact the affordability and sustainability of food production?
Week 2: What causes infectious disease in animals?
Week 3: How does the host respond to infectious disease?
Week 4: What is the impact of caregivers, the environment, and management systems on host response and disease transmission?
Week 5: How do infectious diseases behave in production animal populations?
Week 6: How do pathogens, animal management practices, and cultural norms influence human health?

Recommended Background
Some understanding of the following will help maximize your learning experience:
Basic mammalian biology
Rudimentary microbiology
Fundamentals of immunology
Livestock husbandry
Animal production cycles
Suggested Readings
None.
Course Format
The class will consist of lecture videos that are between 8 and 12 minutes in length and contain 1-2 integrated quiz questions per video. There will also be standalone homeworks that are not part of video lectures and other activities. Discussion with other participants will provide excellent networking opportunities.
FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?

	<field name="course_intro">Sustainability in Practice
Sustainability is a practice operating across a variety of scales and skills. We will explore the ways that decision makers use systems analysis and design thinking to confront the career-defining challenges facing the next generation of leaders. Networks of practice from across North America and around the globe will provide case material and guest lectures.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Sustainability is defining a generation of students and young professionals and their influence is transforming things like cities, companies, and laws around the world. Sustainability is often explained as meeting “the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” In practice, this means understanding connections, including connections across time. These connections create systems that are greater than the simple sums of their parts, with consequences that are often unexpected by people paying attention to only one part of a system. This course provides an introduction to the ideas and practices that people are using to understand and change these connections in pursuing more sustainable processes, communities, environments, and organizations. 

Systems theory appears in many guises and most disciplines claim some share of the systems approach to connections and consequences. In ways that we will explore in the course, design thinking is a method for putting systems theory into practice. Designers and their way of thinking provide a significant contribution to sustainability in practice, from improving energy performance in buildings to identifying the value ecosystems services provide to human settlements. This course has several strategic partners providing us with content and with platforms for discussion. These networks will provide the course with an extensive and diverse portfolio of problems, solutions, illustrations, and challenges with which to explore the ideas presented above. We will use these very different venues as platforms for discussion and will organize student conversations and assignments using the network partners.     

Course Syllabus
Week 1: CONNECTIONS  What is sustainability? Links between sustainability and earlier ideas. Who does it, why, and how? Examples of how sustainability is used as by governments and enterprises. What is a system? Illustrations of parts, linkages, feedbacks, and leverage points. What is design thinking?    
Week 2: ACCOUNTING What is an efficient allocation of resources? What are the consequences of mis-allocating resources? Examples of externalities, commons problems, and cognitive bias. Discussion of lifecycle costs, behavioral influence, and aligning incentives.

Week 3: RESILIENCE What is the relationship between mitigation of and adaptation to challenges to sustainability? What makes a system more and less resilient? How are people making cities and companies and landscapes more resilient in the face of challenges such as sea-level rise or energy scarcity or food security?  

Week 4: EMERGENCE Resource efficiency and system integrity seek to balance flows over time. What is emergence? How does design thinking generate productive emergence and what strategies exist for anticipating and responding to emergent threats? 
Week 5: JURISDICTION Who decides when resources have been accounted for, if a system is resilient enough, or whether an emerging trend is a threat or opportunity? At what scale and over what questions will such decisions be made? 
Week 6: PERFORMANCE Even once sustainable outcomes are legitimized into goals and decided on through commitments, how are these outcomes achieved? How would we know? Discussion of competitions and incentives, measurement and management, and new methods of regulating performance and compliance. 
Week 7: DISRUPTION How are existing roles and professions being disrupted by the demands of sustainability? Discussion of big data, simplifying system complexity, and the adaptation of legacy assets to new purposes. 
Week 8: CONNECTIONS Summary of discussions and of emerging questions. Evaluate the claim that sustainability in practice is about using design thinking to understand and manipulate systems.

Part of the &quot;Systems Biology&quot; Specialization »
An introduction to current concepts of how cellular molecules come together to form systems, how these systems exhibit emergent properties, and how these properties are used to make cellular decisions.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This course will introduce the student to contemporary Systems Biology focused on mammalian cells, their constituents and their functions. Biology is moving from molecular to modular. As our knowledge of our genome and gene expression deepens and we develop lists of molecules (proteins, lipids, ions) involved in cellular processes, we need to understand how these molecules interact with each other to form modules that act as discrete functional systems. These systems underlie core subcellular processes such as signal transduction, transcription, motility and electrical excitability. In turn these processes come together to exhibit cellular behaviors such as secretion, proliferation and action potentials. What are the properties of such subcellular and cellular systems? What are the mechanisms by which emergent behaviors of systems arise? What types of experiments inform systems-level thinking? Why do we need computation and simulations to understand these systems?

The course will develop multiple lines of reasoning to answer the questions listed above. Two major reasoning threads are: the design, execution and interpretation of multivariable experiments that produce large data sets; quantitative reasoning, models and simulations. Examples will be discussed to demonstrate “how” cell- level functions arise and “why” mechanistic knowledge allows us to predict cellular behaviors leading to disease states and drug responses.

This is an Exploratorium Teacher Institute professional development course open to any middle or high school science teacher. This course is designed to help science teachers infuse their curriculum with hands-on STEM activities that support the NGSS engineering practices.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This is a hands-on workshop that explores various strategies that middle and high school teachers can use to integrate engineering practices into science lessons and laboratory investigations that they already do. We will start by comparing and contrasting the research methods employed by scientists and engineers, then demonstrate ways that teachers can facilitate, sequence, and assess lessons designed to help students understand and apply engineering principles. These principles include learning to (1) design within constraints, (2) analyze and interpret data, (3) construct models, and (4) conduct iterative tests. Upon completing this course, teachers will possess a deeper understanding of engineering and be able to effectively teach engineering processes to their students.
Course Syllabus
Week One: Learning from Failure
One of the best ways to introduce and understand engineering practices is by studying real-life examples, including what went wrong. We&#39;ll look at some famous engineering failures (and successes) and explore teaching applications.

Week Two: Science and Engineering Thinking
The Next Generation Science Standards explicitly call out the differences between science and engineering. We&#39;ll use exhibits from the Exploratorium museum floor to illustrate some of these differences, and ask you to re-imagine your own science activity from an engineering perspective.

Week Three: Modeling Activities
A hallmark of the Exploratorium Teacher Institute is that we have developed lots of &quot;snacks&quot; over the years: hands-on teaching activities (thoroughly tested by students and teachers) that explore scientific phenomena using easy-to-obtain materials. This week, we&#39;ll share some of our favorites and ask you to try them out at home. 

Week Four: Develop Your Own Engineering Activity
It&#39;s your turn! Take what you&#39;ve learned in the class and create your own mini-lesson. You can adapt one of our activities or come up with your own and get feedback and tips from other students in the class.
Recommended Background
This course is appropriate for any middle or high school teacher interested in learning how to incorporate engineering activities into their science curriculum. Formal training in the physical or life sciences is highly recommended (BA/BS in science or equivalent).
Suggested Readings
We recommend that participants familiarize themselves with the Next Generation Science Standards (specifically, the engineering practices) before starting this course.

The website nextgenscience.org gives a good overview of the new standards, which is organized along three primary dimensions.

The full text of the NGSS framework is available for free from the National Academies Press: A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas

You can also watch these short videos from Paul Anderson of Bozeman Science, which do a great job of explaining specific NGSS practices in detail:

ETS1A - Defining &amp; Delimiting an Engineering Problem
ETS1B - Developing Possible Solutions
ETS1C - Optimizing the Design Solution
ETS2A - Interdependence of Science, Engineering &amp; Technology
ETS2B - Influence of Science, Engineering &amp; Technology on Society &amp; the Natural World

Course Format
Each week will include 2-4 short videos highlighting aspects of engineering practice. Course participants will be asked to try out some activities and also reflect on and critically examine the engineering activities. Participants will also examine strategies for monitoring student learning. Links to engineering activities and teaching resources will be provided. There will also be readings and assignments to complete.
FAQ
•  Will I get a certificate after completing this class that I can show to my district? 
Yes. Participants who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.  It will indicate that you completed 12 hours.</field>

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
On the Hunt for Feedback: Self-Directed Teacher Improvement

Teaching is isolating.  Most of the work happens behind a closed door.  Teachers want feedback about their teaching, but encounter three problems:

1. They don&#39;t get much.  The principal or department head doesn&#39;t visit very often.  And there’s no built-in structure at their school for peer observation.

2. The feedback isn&#39;t helpful or actionable.

Sometimes it&#39;s just happy talk -- 98% of American teachers are rated satisfactory -- and while everyone likes a pat on the back, evaluations that say &quot;you were wonderful&quot; don&#39;t make better teachers.  Or sometimes the feedback is critical in ways that don’t present clear next steps.  Sometimes it&#39;s vague or just plain wrong.  

3. Some teachers can be defensive.  

(Yes, we know – only SOME people are defensive, but not YOU.  You are different.  You handle feedback with grace, confidence, and a &quot;let&#39;s fix this&quot; orientation. {Except sometimes maybe not.})

***

This course is based on a simple idea: that teachers take control of their own improvement by aggressively seeking out and acting upon feedback about their teaching.

The idea may be simple, but the work is not. So we should say straight up: this is NOT a typical MOOC. Participants in this MOOC won’t improve their teaching skills by just watching lectures. Participants also won’t really take anything away from this MOOC if they do it “a la carte:” we believe they need to do every part of every assignment in order to leverage the kinds of changes in practice that we think are possible in a course like this.

We all wish that our public school system was such that every teacher would have easy access to great coaching – or even any coaching at all. But unfortunately that’s not the world we live in. Indeed, high school athletes can EXPECT to be coached, but schoolteachers somehow need to track it down themselves. Teachers deserve better. But they have a choice: bemoan the lack of legit coaching that they get and will likely continue to get, or become the rare teacher who builds her own improvement loop.  

Class 1: The Big Picture on Teacher Feedback

We will review the realities of teacher feedback in typical schools, looking at where that feedback usually comes to teachers and how it’s processed.  In most schools, the teacher plays a passive role in this—waiting until an evaluation comes to them.  We believe the best teachers create the opposite type of process: they HUNT down feedback, drag it back to their lairs, and use it.  They realize that if they wait for good feedback to come to them, they might wait a long, long time.  

Class 2:  Case Study: Peer Feedback

We profile teachers who&#39;ve asked their peers to give them critical feedback. How did they ask their colleagues for help? What rubric or observation protocol did they use? How did they choose what to focus on after they got the feedback? What kind of action/improvement plan did the teacher write? What happened when the teachers tried to implement their action steps? What did their peers say when they came back to their classroom a few weeks later?

Participants in this course will do the exact same assignment: they will seek out feedback from a peer to generate their own action plan and a reflection on its implementation. Participants will also be assigned to give and receive feedback on these action plans from other students in our MOOC who are working on similar focus areas in similar contexts (e.g. other math teachers who are trying to improve the rigor of their questioning).

Class 3: Case Study: Student Feedback  

First we review the emerging new evidence, from the Gates Foundation MET Project, about student surveys and their power for accurately assessing teachers’ strengths and weaknesses.  Then, similar to the Peer Feedback class, we show a teacher going through all the steps, interspersed with commentary from the course instructor.

Again, our MOOC participants will do the same assignment: create a student survey (we’ll show you examples); administer the survey; tabulate the data; write and implement a plan; and get and give feedback from/to a peer with a similar focus area.

Class 4: Case Study: Assessment Data

First we cover the evidence of how schools and teachers are using student assessment data to drive instructional improvements. Then we once again examine examples of teachers who go through all of the steps of administering a unit assessment, analyzing the data, and designing and implementing a targeted instructional intervention.

MOOC participants will do the same assignment, and then get and give feedback from/to a peer who teaches a similar subject and/or grade level.  

Course Learning Outcomes:

To describe both structural and psychological impediments to teachers receiving effective feedback about their practice, as well as strategies to overcome those impediments. 
To engage in self-directed improvement via three types of data collection—action plan—reflection assignments: peer observation, student surveys, and student assessment data analysis.
To provide critical support and feedback to fellow MOOC participants who have similar teaching contexts and/or improvement focus areas. 
Recommended Background
You must be actively teaching in some type of K-12 setting in order to take this course. That&#39;s the only prerequisite. 
Course Format
This course is expected to have four 60-minute interactive sessions that are a mix of video-based case studies and self-monitored writing exercises.

Students will complete three types of assignments in response to each of the three feedback case studies: 

(1) A 2 page written action plan that addresses the feedback that you collected. 

(2) A 2 page written reflection that addresses the implementation of your action plan. 

(3) An assessment of another course participant’s action plan/reflection assignment.

Students will have three weeks between class sessions in which to complete each assignment. For example, after the Peer Feedback Case Study class, students will have three weeks to collect peer feedback, write an action plan, implement and reflect on their action plan, and then assess the work of another course participant. Students should plan to spend 3-4 hours between sessions completing coursework.</field>

Positive psychology meets K-12 pedagogy. This course explores key ideas of positive psychology and shows how great teachers apply those lessons to maximize student engagement and accomplishment. Through lectures, discussions, interviews and footage of great educators in action, you’ll learn how to integrate character-based objectives into your own teaching.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Psychology, sociology, and neuroscience point to the existence of a set of developable character strengths that serve as building blocks for positive life outcomes. That’s why, in our view, character development and content mastery act as the two complementary halves of remarkable teaching. But they’re often perceived to be in competition. When you ask parents about their goals for their children, they almost always respond with terms like, “successful,” “happy,” “curious,” and “being kind to others.” But when you ask schools about their goals, they often reply in terms of academic content, like “algebra,” “subject-verb agreement,” and “the periodic table.” 

Great teachers have always united those two visions. 

This course explores the interconnection between character research, education, and academic rigor. During our sessions, we’ll cover the field of positive psychology as it relates to character strengths, as well as the concepts of Growth Mindset, Constructive Responding, and Character Behavior Language. We will engage with the existing research, hear from eminent scholars in the field and top K-12 educators, and view footage of classroom teachers integrating these ideas into their classroom instruction. 

The course will explore questions like: 

How can positive psychology help us maximize student engagement and accomplishment?
What does it look like to implement a growth mindset in your classroom?
Can you teach grit in the classroom? If so, how?
Should an educator measure character? If so, how? 
Course Syllabus
Week One: Why Teach Character - Introductions to the research that supports character education. This is where psychology&#39;s leading researchers join us to share their guidance on what every teacher should do to teach character.  

Week Two: How to Teach Character (micro-moments) - Focus on teaching character in the classroom by leveraging micro-moments. 

Week Three: How to Teach Character (macro structures ) - Focus on teaching character in the classroom by leveraging macro structures. 

Week Four: Character Growth - Introduction to the Character Growth Card (CGC) and how teachers can facilitate conversations about growth over a period of time


Recommended Background
We believe this course will have broad applicability for anyone who works with kids – teachers, social workers, counselors, coaches, and even parents who are curious about how these ideas might be applied at home or in their child’s school.  We&#39;ve built this course for you. The material will affect how you plan, how you teach, and what vision you have for your students&#39; futures.

We are part of the &#39;TechniCity&#39;. The increasing availability of networks, sensors and mobile technologies allows for new approaches to address the challenges that our cities face. The way we understand cities is undergoing sweeping transformation, right along with the analytical tools we use to design our cities and the communication tools we use to engage people. Absorbing, studying and understanding the role of technology from a critical viewpoint allows us to generate creative ideas for improving our cities.  

This course begins by examining how our cities are changing. We then jump into how technology is used to engage with the public to support decision-making and the creative ways that every-day people are using technology to improve their cities.   Students will be examining tools for analyzing the city. Then we move into exploring the fascinating ways that cities are using real-time, technology. You&#39;ll hear from technological innovators and thought leaders about all of these topics. You will get to engage around a topic you are most interested in to create a project in your own city.

	<field name="course_intro">Technology and Ethics
The meteoric rise of technologies used in our everyday life for profit, power, or improvement of an individual&#39;s life can, on occasion, cause cultural stress as well as ethical challenges. In this course, we will explore how these multifaceted impacts might be understood, controlled and mitigated.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
When everyone begins pursuing their rights to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness we are bound to step on each other’s toes.  This begs the need for regulations.  And this leads to the question as to “what is moral behavior”; and what are the ethics that emanate from the selected definitions of moral behavior. There is no dearth of defined moral behavior created by religions and their leaders, business persons, politicians, philosophers, and in some cases “the everyday person on the street”. 

Example technologies at play today include nuclear energy; biological manipulations for warfare; robots for taking care of the elderly, and enhancing human capability; the use of technology for surveillance; the cultural changing power of the media which can create unlimited arrays of images real and virtual to support a point of view; and the internet with its world wide connectivity. 

We need to look into social/technology assessment, the transfer of the technology as it is placed into practice, and the techniques/processes that are available for control within the legal, political, institutional and attitudinal environment within which the technology is placed as a way of protecting our rights to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness.

Students, policy makers, journalists or anyone with a strong interest in terrorism and counter terrorism studies and trends will find the course most relevant. It will equip you with a range of insights that help you to analyze and understand these complex phenomena.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Terrorism has arguably been one of the defining factors of our age. It frequently makes headlines, threatening or attacking governments, private business and ordinary citizens. And in many parts of the world, it has been one of the most important threats to peace, security and stability. But what does this exactly mean? What is the nature of this threat? Who or what is threatened, how, by whom and why? What can be done about it or how can we at least limit the impact of terrorism and make sure that terrorists do not make headlines and manage to scare us?

These are just a handful of questions that will be addressd in this course that consists of three parts. First it focuses on the essence of terrorism as an instrument to achieve certain goals, in addition to an exploration of this phenomenon and the difficulties in defining it. The second part provides an overview of the state of the art in (counter) terrorism studies. Since ‘9/11’ terrorism studies have grown exponentially, reflecting the rise in perceived threats. But what has academia come up with? What theories, assumptions and conventional wisdom has it produced that could be of help in understanding terrorism and dealing with it? The most interesting results are examined and compared with empirical evidence with the aim to either stress their importance or to debunk them as myths. The final part looks into the implications and possibilities for policy making.



Course Syllabus
Week 1: What is terrorism?
Week 2: Researching terrorism and counterterrorism
Week 3: Five assumptions on terrorism
Week 4: Five assumptions on counterterrorism
Week 5: Dealing with terrorism and the future

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Every dog owner should have some understanding of reproduction, whether they intend to breed that dog or just want to have their dog spayed or castrated. As a dog enthusiast, you want to know what is best for your dog and to understand your veterinarian’s recommendations. This course is intended to give you the background knowledge necessary to help you achieve those goals. 

Students in this course will learn the basics of anatomy and reproductive physiology necessary to understand reproduction control, and the diagnosis and management of reproductive tract disease in male and female dogs. My goal is to provide you with background information that will help you work with your veterinarian to make the best decisions for your dog.


Course Syllabus
Week 1: Female dog anatomy / The estrous cycle

Week 2: Breeding management / Pregnancy and whelping

Week 3: Female dog reproductive tract disorders

Week 4: Male dog anatomy / Semen collection and evaluation / Artificial insemination

Week 5: Male dog reproductive tract disorders

Week 6: Contraception and sterilization of female and male dogs

Recommended Background
Participants should have a basic grasp of biology and general familiarity with dog anatomy and normal dog behavior. 
Suggested Readings
Much of the material for this course will be taken from The Dog Breeder’s Guide to Successful Breeding and Health Management (ISBN:1-4160-3139-1). Another text that is very helpful for dog breeders is Canine Reproduction by Phyllis Holst (ISBN 978-1-57779-114-0). Students with purebred dogs also may find much information on the website from their national breed club, especially for those with breeds registered with the American Kennel Club (AKC). Finally, all students should feel free to contact their veterinarian with questions or concerns about any dog for which you are responsible. 
Course Format
I will start each session with a case for you to think about, provide a couple of brief video lectures (5-15 minutes in length) followed by short activities to check your understanding. We&#39;ll conclude each session with a review of the most important points and an explanation of the case with which we started. For more advanced students, a question will be posted that will require you to find your own resources. I will also provide references to written materials that may help you better understand the concepts or to learn more about topics of particular interest to you.

I will be using correct veterinary terminology throughout the course, both in written materials and in video presentations. That means that I will refer to an unspayed female dog as a bitch. I also will be using correct terms for anatomy. This is not intended to be shocking or unsettling. Use of correct terminology ensures clear understanding. Similarly, some images may be graphic but they are used to demonstrate a disease state or correct performance of a procedure and are intended for your education.

This introductory physical chemistry course examines the connections between molecular properties and the behavior of macroscopic chemical systems.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Statistical Molecular Thermodynamics is a course in physical chemistry that relates the microscopic properties of molecules to the macroscopic behavior of chemical systems. Quantized molecular energy levels and their use in the construction of molecular and ensemble partition functions is described. Thermodynamic state functions, their dependence on the partition function, and their relationships with one another (as dictated by the three Laws of Thermodynamics) are all examined in detail. Analysis and demonstration takes place primarily in the context of ideal and real gases. This eight-week course covers slightly more than half of a typical semester-long course in chemical thermodynamics. Typical topics to be addressed subsequently would be phase equilibria, liquids, solutions of non-electrolytes and electrolytes, and chemical reaction equilibria. 

Students who successfully complete the course will be able to predict how changes in molecular properties will influence the macroscopic behavior of those substances; they will understand the relationships between energy, heat, and work, and be able to predict how much work can be extracted from a given chemical process under various sets of conditions; they will understand the role of entropy in physical and chemical processes; and they will be able to engineer conditions to make chemical reactions spontaneously favorable (or not). Students will also become adept with differential calculus as a tool to derive and manipulate relationships between connected thermodynamic variables and state functions.

“I&#39;d like to thank both professors for the course. It was fun, instructive, and I loved the input from people from all over the world, with their different views and backgrounds.”

“Somewhere in the first couple weeks of the course, I was ruminating over some concept or perhaps over one of the homework exercises and suddenly it occurred to me, &quot;&#39;Is this what thinking is?&quot; Just to clarify, I come from a thinking family and have thought a lot about various concepts and issues throughout my life and career...but somehow I realized that, even though I seemed to be thinking all the time, I hadn&#39;t been doing this type of thinking for quite some time...so, thanks!”


“The rapport between Dr. Sinott-Armstrong and Dr. Neta and their senses of humor made the lectures engaging and enjoyable. Their passion for the subject was apparent and they were patient and thorough in their explanations.”


The course has also been featured in a number of news articles and news reports.  Here are links to some of these:

Tinkering activities provide a powerful way to inspire students&#39; interest, engagement, and understanding in science. The Tinkering Fundamentals course will help educators and enthusiasts develop a practice of tinkering and making. This course will focus on key design elements of high-quality, science-rich tinkering activities, effective facilitation strategies and environmental organization.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
The Tinkering Fundamentals course will offer educators and enthusiasts an opportunity to develop a practice of tinkering and making.  We see tinkering as a serious endeavor -- one that is generalizable across content and especially good at interweaving disciplines in a way that leads to complex projects and individualized learning opportunities.  

Tinkering has recently been introduced into the educational field as a potential driver of creativity, excitement, and innovation in science learning. It is seen by many as an effective means to engage in exploring STEM concepts, practices and phenomena. Tinkering typically blends the high and low tech tools of science along with a strong aesthetic dimension that supports children&#39;s (and adults) self expression.  For over a decade, the Exploratorium has been developing science-rich tinkering activities. Working with learning scientists, we have identified a set of design principles and indicators of learning that can help you to integrate tinkering activities into your elementary and middle school science programs. This course will focus on key design elements of high quality science-rich tinkering activities, facilitation strategies, and environmental organization. Selected  tinkering activities will be centered around circuits for this course.  We will review the ways in which tinkering supports science learning through providing opportunities to deepen engagement, intentionality, innovation, collaboration, and understanding. This course will excite you, inspire you, and get you tinkering in no time.
Course Syllabus
Week One: Introduction to Tinkering
What is tinkering? Is it different from engineering or other forms of making?

Week Two: Initial Explorations
What better way to learn about tinkering than to try it! We invite you to start by playing with circuit boards.

Week Three: Learning Dimensions
This week, it&#39;s scribbling machines! We&#39;ll also investigate how tinkering maps on to different indicators of learning.

Week Four: Tinkering Tenets and Personal Expression
Try your hand with paper circuits and sewn circuits, and explore the aesthetic dimensions of tinkering, including key design elements and basic principles.

Week Five: Coding, Computation and Facilitation Strategies
A look at the high-tech side of tinkering, plus strategies for facilitation and deep engagement.

Week Six: Putting It All Together
It&#39;s your turn! How will you take what you&#39;ve learned in this class and apply it to your own life? We&#39;ll help you come up with a detailed action plan and get feedback from other students in the class.

PLEASE NOTE: because this is a hands-on workshop, you will need materials to complete the weekly activities at home. Pre-bundled materials are available for purchase at the Art of Tinkering website or you can purchase the items individually on your own.

Each week there will be several short videos to watch, each with a specific focus intended to highlight elements of the tinkering process we have developed: 
(1) Seeing it in action: A glimpse of what the activity looks like in action here in the Exploratorium&#39;s Tinkering Studio, a public space on the museum floor. 
(2) Design principles: We dissect the ways we design experiences for others with tinkerability in mind.
(3) Inspiration: In our work at the Exploratorium, we often partner with artists and makers.  We will highlight a few of our favorites.  Visiting with them in their work spaces to talk about their work as it connects to the activities we&#39;re doing in the course.
(4) Classroom connection &amp; pedagogical perspectives: These videos will concentrate on the learning involved in tinkering.  Teachers who have used the activities with students reflect on their experience. We also interview key thinkers in the field to get their perspectives on tinkering and it&#39;s potential impact on teaching and learning.
(5) Making how to: A close look at the materials we use and how we approach construction with visitors to the museum.

We hope to offer weekly opportunities for informal conversations among participants. Instructors will also answer questions, participate on the discussion forums and call out interesting conversations taking place.

Recommended Background
This course is suitable for everyone from advanced secondary or high school students to billion dollar hedge fund managers.  It requires no complicated mathematical training.  While a previous study of microeconomics might be useful in more quickly assimilating some of the graphical material, it is certainly not a pre-requisite.

Suggested Readings
It is unnecessary to use a standard macroeconomics textbook to learn the material presented in this course.  However, if you are interested in a companion book to this course, I can heartily recommend Macroeconomics by David Colander published by McGraw-Hill-Hill as an optional text.  This is perhaps my favorite textbook because it emphasizes the historical evolution of macroeconomic theory and practice – one of the major themes of this course.

As you take this course, you may also want to keep up with the latest macroeconomic news by reading newspapers like the Financial Times or Wall Street Journal or perhaps subscribing to the weekly magazine, the Economist.

My own book, Always a Winner, may be useful if you are interested in learning more about forecasting the economy and business cycle and using that forecasting information to strategically manage a firm or organization.

If you are more interested in a career in money management or want to learn more about how an understanding of macroeconomics can help you better manage your own investment portfolio, you may also want to read my book When the Market Moves, Will You Be Ready? as an optional text.

Course Format
This is a complete college and MBA-level course in the principles of macroeconomics as normally taught in a quarter or semester timeframe. 

The centerpiece of the course is a set of eleven lectures, broken down into 5 to 7 topics per multimedia presentations, specifically designed to simulate the traditional classroom lecture experience; and each lecture covers topics such as inflation, unemployment, fiscal policy, monetary policy, and, in this age of globalization, exchange rates and the economics of free trade.

These multimedia presentations feature a digitally-mastered audio sound track; and each slide in a typical presentation will include an outline of material from the audio track, dynamically constructed graphs such as the Keynesian model, animated charts and figures, and historical photos of people such as Adam Smith, John Maynard Keynes and Ben Bernanke, or some combination thereof.

To make these lectures as interesting – and as fun -- as possible, each is highly interactive so that throughout each lecture, you will be asked numerous questions and you should feel free at any time to put the presentation on pause as you contemplate possible answers.

After each lecture, you will be able to take an online quiz and immediately after you complete the quiz, you also will be able to check both your grade and your answers.  At the end of the course, you will then be able to take a final exam online to see how well you did in the course.

FAQ
Will I get a certificate after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete this class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment from Coursera.

What resources will I need for this class?
The course is self-contained, with other reading material amplifying the analysis and application of economic reasoning.

Does this class prepare me for admission to an MBA program?
This course in Macroeconomics is an appropriate course for satisfying any pre-MBA requirement in macroeconomics. It can also be used in MBA programs.  (Students are advised to check with their own universities&#39; academic advisers on the acceptance of this course for academic credit in their undergraduate and MBA programs.)

Is there an open license to the materials included in this course?
Yes, some materials are available for reuse under a Creative Commons license from the UC Irvine OpenCourseWare site.</field>

Preview Lectures</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Terrorism Studies does not fall within any one traditional academic discipline, and it is often plagued by subjectivity and a lack of empirical data. The National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), a Department of Homeland Security Center of Excellence housed at the University of Maryland, will apply its multi-disciplinary and mixed-method approach to research in this course, utilizing theory and quantitative and qualitative research from a range of the social and behavioral sciences including Criminology, Psychology, Political Science and Communications Studies.

The course will begin with a unit looking at widely held myths about terrorism and utilizing empirical data to discuss the realities of broad trends and patterns in terrorist attacks over time.  The course will then review the psychological factors at play in individual radicalization and recruitment into terrorism, followed by an analysis of terrorist group dynamics.  The course will next look to factors that allow terrorist groups to successfully carry out attacks, such as propaganda, use of media, financing, recruitment, and training.  The course will conclude by looking at the factors that drive terrorist group persistence/endurance versus terrorist group desistance, and will bring the varied course concepts together through a detailed look at the case of al-Qa’ida, including the group’s successes, failures, tactics, and strategies.  Throughout the course, students will work with the University of Maryland’s Global Terrorism Database (GTD), the largest database of terrorist incidents in the world, learning its capabilities and developing basic skills in searching and displaying appropriate and accurate sets of terrorism data.

This course &#39;Unethical decision making in organizations : A seminar on the dark side of the force&#39; will teach you how strong organizational contexts push good people towards unethical decisions. You will also learn how to protect yourself and your organization against such forces lurking in the dark.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Whenever we hear about ethical scandals, we tend to believe that unethical or illegal behavior in organizations is driven by character deficiencies of individual actors. Put differently, we simply assume that bad things are done by bad people (so-called bad apples). However, numerous corporate scandals, such as Enron, Ford, or Siemens, have demonstrated that even people with a high level of integrity can break the rules if they are put into a corrupt context. Good apples may become rotten in bad barrels. Regardless of their good intentions and strong values, individual actors might adapt to the unethical practices in their respective organizational context and, over time, lose the ability to see their wrongdoings. They become ethically blind. Such changes in people’s way of seeing the world and their value systems can occur in—and through—various organizational contexts in business, civil society, and public administration. This course is not about apples but about barrels and barrel makers. A better understanding of why and under what conditions good people make bad ethical decisions will enable us to better protect individuals as well as their respective organizations against the overwhelming power of the context. It will also enable us to cure societies from problems like corruption.

The goal of this course is to empower students to analyze the risks of unethical or illegal behavior that might be triggered by powerful contexts. It will draw from various disciplines such as management, psychology, sociology, philosophy, and literature, in order to learn what these disciplines contribute to a better understanding of unethical behavior. The course will also analyze some of the most eminent organizational scandals of the recent decades through the lenses of these disciplines.
Course Syllabus
Broad outline of the topics covered in the seminar:

Introduction: Evil in ancient and modern thought
Ethical decisions in organizations: Dealing with dilemma situations
Making sense of unethical decisions in organizations – The Pinto case
The power of frames: How people (mis)construct their world(s) – The Enron case
The power of routines
The power of strong situations
The power of temporal dynamics
The power of institutions
The concept of ethical blindness
The wind of change: How to fight ethical blindness
Recommended Background
No background expertise is required. The course is open for interested layperson as well as experts who work on related topics, be it as researchers or practitioners (e.g., compliance managers in corporations).
Suggested Readings
All the material will be provided electronically (and free of charge) at the beginning of the course.
Course Format
The course will consist of video lectures (with and without interactive quiz questions), live discussions combining live webcast and Twitter, and discussion forums in which students will discuss questions related to the course. Students are encouraged to provide their own stories and experiences with regards to unethical organizational decisions. A selection of those stories and experiences will be discussed by the two teachers in weekly reflections on course progress. 

The final grade will be based on the students’ performance on weekly homework assignments, which will include essays in which the students reflect upon the ideas presented in the course, for instance, by relating these ideas to their own context.
FAQ
Will I get a certificate after completing this class?
Students who successfully complete the class will receive a certificate signed by the instructors.

Why is this course important for me?
Currently, the understanding of why good people make unethical decisions is rather limited, related research is rather fragmented, and the management of such problems in organizations is overly simplistic, legalistic, and inadequate. Understanding contexts, including the dangers of routines, the mindlessness of our daily decisions, and the healing power of mindful decision-making routines is of increasing importance. In this course, you will learn the latest knowledge and the appropriate tool box for dealing with ethical challenges that you will face throughout your life!

What do I need to follow this course?
We build bridges between various scientific disciplines and will familiarize you with those disciplines smoothly. You need no expertise, just come and share your own real-world experiences about unethical decisions. After all, we are all experts in making decisions—some more ethically, some less ethically—aren’t we?</field>

ABOUT THE COURSE 

Not too long ago, it was believed that anyone who graduated from a doctoral program was capable of teaching. In recent years, however, it has become apparent that teaching is not an intuitive behavior. In addition to content, teaching also involves a complex intellectual process, and to develop the “art” of teaching, professors require guidance and support. As the roles and responsibilities of university-level educators have evolved and expanded in recent years, the preparation of emerging university faculty leaders must focus on the development of the knowledge, skills, and strategies for teaching and learning in higher education. This short course is designed to introduce the strategies and exemplars of university teaching skills necessary to meet these new professional demands for teaching at a university level.

This course explores musculoskeletal anatomy of the Upper Limb, and common injuries that affect its function. We discuss parts of the upper limb, the anatomy of bones, joints and muscles, nerve injuries and common pathologies.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
In the first six weeks of the course, we begin with an introduction to the parts of the upper limb and a discussion of the anatomic position, including the three-dimensional planes in which body movements are performed. Next, we cover the osteology of the upper limb by describing the bones of the extremity, how they articulate at synovial joints, and the movements that are possible at these joints. We explore the blood supply and innervation to the upper limb. We then discuss the major muscles that act at each joint, pointing out what muscles allow us to shrug our shoulders, row a boat, make a fist, and rotate our hand forwards or backwards. 

In the final three weeks of the course, we investigate nerve injuries that occur in the upper limb and their clinical effects. We also explore common pathologies that appear in the extremity, such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, gout, and Dupuytren&#39;s contracture. We finish with a description of the embryologic development of the upper limb and common causes of limb malformations and deformations. 

Please note that some lectures in this course contain graphic medical images, including illustrations of the human body, and photographs of birth defects and other medical conditions. Discretion is advised.

This course focuses on how to design and build secure systems with a human-centric focus. We will look at basic principles of human-computer interaction, and apply these insights to the design of secure systems with the goal of developing security measures that respect human performance and their goals within a system.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
In many systems, human users are a critical part of the security process. They create passwords, follow security protocols, and share information that can maintain or destroy the security of a system. However, many secure systems are designed with little to no attention paid to people&#39;s cognitive abilities, workflow, or tasks. As a result, people find ways around the security obstacles that get in the way of their work.

This course focuses on how to design and build secure systems with a human-centric focus. We will look at basic principles of human-computer interaction, including the basics of humans&#39; cognitive abilities, principles of usability, design techniques, and evaluation methods. We will then apply these insights to the design of secure systems with the goal of developing security measures that respect human performance and their goals within a system.

Through hands-on exercises designing, building, evaluating, and critiquing systems, students will learn how to integrate usability into secure software. The course will specifically focus on authentication mechanisms, browsing security, privacy and social media, and mobile security.

	<field name="course_intro">Understanding and Improving the US Healthcare System
In this course, you will learn about the structure, accomplishments, and shortcomings of the US healthcare system, and how those have prompted attempts at reform. You will also take part in a unique, national group exercise, designed to help you understand how you can improve the US healthcare system.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Health is important to everyone.  For most people, that means that understanding the healthcare system is important.  As a patient or a caregiver for a loved one, your understanding of the system can mean everything from getting the right help, to economic stress in paying medical bills, to medical misadventures and even death.  And if you’re a healthcare professional (or are in training or want to be a healthcare professional someday), understanding the system is a critical – but often under-developed – part of optimizing the help you can provide your community.

 

Despite this importance, an understanding of the US healthcare system is alarmingly rare.  This course is designed to change that – by helping students understand the core structure and accomplishments of the system, the recurring shortcomings, and attempted remedies through policy reform.  Rather than emphasizing complexity (a focus of many other courses about healthcare policy), the lessons in this course will highlight central themes that learners can take away from the course and apply to their own experiences – and other coursework – with confidence.  Moreover, students who seek more advanced content will have ample opportunity to tailor their learning accordingly.

 

In addition, through a unique, national group exercise that will serve as a keystone of this course, all learners will have the opportunity to learn how they can improve the US healthcare system.  Whether as individuals, in groups, or as future architects of system reform, students in this course will enjoy a premier opportunity to understand the US healthcare system – and their options for addressing problems in the system – as they never have before.  This course is produced by Michael Rubyan, MPH, one of Dr. Davis&#39;s former students at the University of Michigan.

Recommended Background
No prerequisites required; all are welcome as this course will bring principles and challenges of the US healthcare system to learners in an accessible way, and will encourage them to examine their own assumptions and experiences as they learn-through-innovation.  The materials are designed to meet the needs and expectation of learners with a broad array of prior experiences in, and knowledge about, the healthcare system.  

Suggested Readings
A small number of primary source readings from the health policy literature will be posted online for students to read and prepare in advance of weekly didactic teaching sessions and learn-through-innovation.
Course Format
In general, each week will consist of approximately 60 minutes of didactic material, delivered in 8- to 15-minute video segments comprised of lecture, thought exercises, and rare archival footage.  Students will be expected to view the video materials, which will include segments that can be tailored to students’ particular interests (including advanced learners).  Each week will also include some work outside of video viewing – to include homework assignments focused on reflecting about and sharing thoughts on the US healthcare system, readings assigned by the instructor, and self-assessments.

 

The exception to this time allotment will occur in Weeks 4 and 5, when students will be randomly assigned to groups for purposes of the group exercise.  The exercise will include expectation of communication with other members of each student’s group, in order to plan benefits in a health plan; time spent on communication will take the place of homework during those weeks
FAQ
Q:  Will a certificate be awarded for this course?

A:  YES – Upon timely completion of two self-evaluations (pre-course; mid-course) and the course evaluation at course end, as well as submission of the plan for health benefits design for each student’s stakeholder group, a student will be eligible to receive a signed Statement of Accomplishment.

Q:  If I have already taken, or plan to take, coursework in health policy elsewhere, is this course still for me?

A:  YES – The goal of this course is to bring learners together from a variety of disciplines, which would be unusual for coursework in just about any other setting.  Moreover, the emphasis in this course is on central themes, rather than complexity that is the hallmark of many other courses in health policy.  Furthermore, a major goal of this course is to help you understand how you can improve the system – in other words, to help each student have a personal, practical, take-away lesson, to complement their improved understanding of the system.</field>

This course will help you understand how the U.S. university application and admission process works for international students and non-native English speakers applying to undergraduate (i.e., bachelor&#39;s degree) programs.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
“It depends.”  That is what you’ll hear when asking about the U.S. university admission process.  With over 4,000 universities in the United States and no standard application system, the U.S. admission process can be confusing for everyone, but especially for students applying from other countries.

This course will help international students (non-U.S. citizens) and non-native English speakers navigate the U.S. university admission process by offering practical information about the documents and pieces that make up a U.S. university application.  More importantly, admission officers will discuss how they use those pieces to decide who is accepted and who is denied, so that you can understand the process beyond the pieces.

By the end of this course, you will understand application basics that include researching schools, creating a school list, and establishing an application plan.  This course will not answer all of your application questions, but it will teach you to ask the right questions of yourself and the universities.  Ultimately, you will have all the information you need to start your process the right way, putting you on the path to acceptance.

* Please note, while the English Language Programs are part of the University of Pennsylvania, this is not a course about applying to Penn.  Furthermore, this course is intended for international students educated in the national curriculum of their country.  While other students are welcome to enroll, the course is not intended for American students or students studying in an American, International Baccalaureate, or Advanced Placement curriculum.  The course is also intended for students who do not have access to university counseling – if you attend a school that offers university counseling, your counselor is the best source of information on applying to university.  Finally, this course is for undergraduate (Bachelors degree) freshmen (students who have not attended any university) applicants.  Undergraduate transfer applicants, students who have attended a university, will find some of the information helpful, but graduate (Masters and Doctoral) applicants will not.

Course Format
The course will consist of a series of short video lectures.  Video lectures will have integrated quiz questions to ensure that you understand the material before moving forward.  The course will also include short-answer homework activities that will form the foundation of your application process after you complete the course.  Discussion forums will be available for student-to-student discussion and to ask questions of their peers and the instruction team.  To earn a Statement of Accomplishment, students must complete all exercises as well as a final, cumulative assignment involving the creation of application materials.  Please note, that while you should be proud of completing the course and earning a Statement of Accomplishment, this Statement should not be mentioned in your university applications.  It is the experience of this course and not the Statement of Accomplishment that will help you in your applications to U.S. universities. 

FAQ
What resources will I need for this class?

For this course, all you need is an Internet connection, an open mind, and the willingness to dedicate hard work to the application process.

Will financial aid or paying for university be discussed in this course?

The financial aid process is even more complex than the admission process.  Because financial aid guidelines can significantly differ from school to school, we will not be reviewing financial aid during this course.  A good source of information regarding financial aid is your country or region&#39;s U.S. Department of State supported EducationUSA Advising Center.

Will this class help me be accepted at the University of Pennsylvania?

This course is about university admission, not admission to Penn.  Taking this class will help you submit your best application for admission, but it in no way will directly help you gain admission to Penn.

What is the English Language Programs (ELP)?

The ELP is an intensive English language program where student can improve their English language abilities.  The ELP also offers a specialized University Connection (UniConn) Program that helps English language learners apply to U.S. universities and prepare for admission tests like the SAT, ACT, and TOEFL.  While the ELP is a University of Pennsylvania program, there is no connection between the ELP and admission to Penn.  For more information, visit ELP.

How do I connect with the course on social media?

You can follow Applying to U.S. Universities on Twitter, join its student community on Facebook, or add it to your circles on Google+.

Does the English Language Program offer other online courses?

Yes, the English Language Program also offers Writing the University Application Essay - Online.  This course is an online writing course intended for international freshman applicants to U.S. colleges and universities. Writing the University Application Essay - Online is designed as a practical process-oriented guide to writing an effective and memorable personal statement.

This course will explore the process of evaluating investigational vaccines in clinical trials including informed consent, recruitment, enrollment, safety evaluation, and quality data collection.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Vaccines are evaluated through a series of clearly defined controlled studies to assess these investigational products for safety, immunogenicity and efficacy before they are approved for licensure.  All clinical vaccine trials are bound by international ethical guidelines and, in the case of US trials, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations.
 
Good Clinical Practice is defined by the International Conferences on Harmonization (ICH) as: “A standard for the design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis, and reporting of clinical trials that provides assurance that the data and reported results are credible and accurate, and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial subjects are protected.”
 
That’s a tall order, so how is it done?  Individuals who enroll as subjects in these trials play an essential role in the development and evaluation of new and improved candidate vaccines.  They are average citizens who volunteer to roll up their sleeves and, in the process, make a tremendous difference in society.  So why do they volunteer and what safeguards do we put in place to protect their rights, safety and well-being while in the trial?  What are the responsibilities of the investigators, sponsors and ethics committees who conduct and oversee these trials? 
 
Along with our colleagues, we will introduce you to how GCP is applied in clinical vaccine trials to ensure proper and ethical scientific conduct. The course will use examples from real vaccine trials to demonstrate the application of the FDA Code of Federal Regulations and ICH GCP Guidelines to explore methods and best practices involved in implementing phase I and II vaccine clinical trials.  This short course offering through Coursera is based on our work at the Center for Immunization Research and an in-depth graduate course taught at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
 
We hope it inspires you to work in this exciting field.
Course Syllabus
This course will cover the following topics: A brief review of vaccine history and types; how vaccine trials are conducted, including which data are collected and how those data are managed and evaluated; appropriate processes to ensure human subjects protection and informed consent; methods for recruitment and enrollment of participants; and vaccine safety assessment. Upon successfully completing this course, students will be able to: 

Describe the types of vaccines in use today
Describe how vaccines are evaluated in phase I and II clinical trials
Identify key regulatory requirements, considerations and ethical standards for human subjects protection and informed consent. 
Discuss how clinical trials are conducted with an emphasis on quality data and protection of the rights, safety and well-being of volunteers.

Violence is among the top three leading causes of injury and death in the US and globally. We will focus on different disciplinary approaches and perspectives to understanding and potentially preventing violence.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Violence is a leading cause of death, disability and health care use in the United States as well as worldwide. Although significant progress has been made in the last few decades, there remains a great need to further reduce the frequency of violence and its long term effects.  Violence causes approximately 50,000 deaths each year and over 2.5 million injuries in the U.S. each year, with an estimated annual cost of $70 billion. Furthermore, violence does not occur in a vacuum; the consequences are also felt through other medical conditions and health behaviors and individuals, families, and communities affected by violence are often irreparably altered.

Violence is a complex problem and can only be understood and reduced though a multidisciplinary approach.  The course will cover the epidemiology of violence; roots of violence including biological, psychological, and social causes (e.g., economic deprivation, religious factors); specific types of violence; media and the arts portrayal of violence; the business/economic impact of violence; physical and mental consequence; and ways to control and prevent violence in our communities, including criminal justice and public health approaches.  Through these perspectives, the course will deepen our understanding of violence in local, national, and global contexts.  

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. Demonstrate knowledge of the problem of violence in the U.S. and globally, as well as the long-term effects.

2. Analyze the causes of and associations with violence from a multidisciplinary perspective.

3. Explore different solutions and programs for the prevention of violence.

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This introductory virology course explores the interplay between viruses and their host organisms. The course begins with an overview of how infection is established in a host, then moves to a virologist&#39;s view of immune defenses.  Next we consider how the replication strategy and the host response determine the outcome of infection, such that some are short and others are of long duration. The mechanisms by which virus infections transform cells in culture are explored, a process that may lead to tumor formation in animals. We then move to a discussion of how viral infections are controlled by vaccines and antiviral drugs. After an introduction to viral evolution, we discuss the principles learned from zoonotic infections, emerging infections, and humankind&#39;s experiences with epidemic and pandemic viral infections. The course ends with an exploration of unusual infectious agents such as viroids, satellites, and prions, followed by a discussion of the causative agent of the most serious current worldwide epidemic, HIV-1.

A modern VLSI chip has a zillion parts -- logic, control, memory, interconnect, etc.  How do we design these complex chips?  Answer: CAD software tools.  Learn how to build these tools in this class.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
A modern VLSI chip is a remarkably complex beast:  billions of transistors, millions of logic gates deployed for computation and control, big blocks of memory, embedded blocks of pre-designed functions designed by third parties (called “intellectual property” or IP blocks).  How do people manage to design these complicated chips?  Answer:  a sequence of computer aided design (CAD) tools takes an abstract description of the chip, and refines it step-wise to a final design. This class focuses on the major design tools used in the creation of an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) or System on Chip (SoC) design.  Our focus is on the key representations that make it possible to synthesize, and to verify, these designs, as they move from logic to layout.   

Our goal is for students to understand how the tools themselves work, at the level of their fundamental algorithms and data structures. You should be taking this course if (1) you are interested in building VLSI design tools;  (2) you are interested in designing VLSI chips, and you want to know why the tools do what they do;  (3) you just like cool algorithms, that work on big cool problems that involve bits, and gates, and geometry, and graphs, and matrices, and time, and...
Course Syllabus
Topics covered will include: Computational boolean algebra; logic verification; logic synthesis (2-level and multi-level); technology mapping; timing analysis; ASIC placement and routing.
Recommended Background
Programming experience (C++, Java) and basic knowledge of data structures and algorithms.  An understanding of basic digital design:  Boolean algebra, Kmaps, gates and flip flops, finite state machine design.  Linear algebra and calculus at the level of a junior or senior in engineering.  Exposure to basic VLSI at an undergraduate level is nice -- but it’s not necessary.  We will keep the course self-contained, but students with some VLSI will be able to skip some background material.
Suggested Readings
The course is designed to be self-contained.  However, we will offer pointers to original source material, i.e., papers in conferences and journals.  This area lacks a single, established “front-to-back” text, that covers logic and layout, as well as representation, optimization, synthesis and verification.  So, we will work to be as complete as possible in the lectures.
Course Format
The class will consist of lecture videos, which are between 15 and 20 minutes in length.  There will also be standalone problem sets (homeworks) that are not part of video lectures, a few programming assignments, and a (not optional) final exam.
FAQ
Will I get a certificate for this course?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a certificate signed by the instructor.

Am I going to learn how to use any industrial design tools in this class?
Nope. This is not a course about “using” other people’s tools. So, it’s not a standard “VLSI Design” sort of a class. This is a course about building software design tools.

What resources will I need for this class?
You need access to a Windows, Mac, or Linux computer to be able to write, compile and run programs. You should be able to program in one of Java or C++. For some programming assignments, you can use any language you like, as long as you can read our input files and write our output file formats.

What is the coolest thing I&#39;ll learn if I take this class?
How it’s possible to synthesize logic and layout using cool algorithms and data structures. Let’s face it: you can build a Karnaugh map with about 6-7 variables, and beyond this your head explodes. Modern designs have a million gates. Clearly, something magical is happening somewhere, to pull this off. Come learn what that magic is.</field>

Volcanic eruptions are a powerful demonstration of the energy of the Earth´s interior. A materials-based understanding of the evolution of erupting systems provides a quantitative physico-chemical description of the nature of lava and magma and the role of experiments in quantifying the eruptive process.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Geoscientists define a “living planet” as one with active volcanism. By this definition our Earth is very much alive, with many eruptions each year and with a far greater number of “active volcanoes” that can potentially erupt in any given year. 

In detail, each eruption is different. Every volcano is its own physical and chemical system, occurs in its own geological location, is subjected to its local stress field, and is at its own stage in evolution in geological time.  External triggers of volcanic eruptions are also believed to play an important role.

Yet powerful generalisations and models of volcanic eruptions are indeed possible and in fact very useful in dealing with the consequences of volcanic eruptions.

How are such models constructed? They must rest on a basis of a mechanistic understanding of what volcanoes are, and what they are doing – not just during eruptions but also in the events leading up to eruptions, and not just at the Earth´s surface but also at depth, where the magma is being prepared for the next eruption.

In addition to field observations of past eruptions, monitoring of signals from magmatic systems, and computer-based simulation of volcanic eruptions, increasingly, high pressure and high temperature experiments are employed in order to answer the question of how volcanic systems work.

These controlled laboratory conditions for experimental volcanology are transforming the study of volcanoes from a chiefly observational discipline where eruptive mechanisms were developed via theoretical analysis of such observations, into a fully modern scientific discipline where such theoretical approaches are either verified or rejected, by the experimental picture of what is possible and what is not.

This course shows you how such experimental insight is obtained and what it tells us about erupting volcanoes.

Preview Lectures</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Much of our daily life is spent taking part in various types of what we might call “political” procedures. Examples range from voting in a national election to deliberating with others in small committees. Many interesting philosophical and mathematical issues arise when we carefully examine our group decision-making processes. 

There are two types of group decision making problems that we will discuss in this course. A voting problem: Suppose that a group of friends are deciding where to go for dinner. If everyone agrees on which restaurant is best, then it is obvious where to go. But, how should the friends decide where to go if they have different opinions about which restaurant is best? Can we always find a choice that is “fair” taking into account everyone’s opinions or must we choose one person from the group to act as a “dictator”? A fair division problem: Suppose that there is a cake and a group of hungry children. Naturally, you want to cut the cake and distribute the pieces to the children as fairly as possible. If the cake is homogeneous (e.g., a chocolate cake with vanilla icing evenly distributed), then it is easy to find a fair division: give each child a piece that is the same size. But, how do we find a “fair” division of the cake if it is heterogeneous (e.g., icing that is 1/3 chocolate, 1/3 vanilla and 1/3 strawberry) and the children each want different parts of the cake?

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Discourse on war and peace has gone through a remarkable transition during the two decades after the end of the Cold War. We do not have to worry of major nuclear wars, and then, no longer can we anticipate stability based on nuclear deterrence. We have no immediate threat emanating from a belligerent adversary equipped with a major arsenal, but we observe a number of small to medium military powers that are more belligerent than the days of the Soviet Union. We have more democracies in the world, and yet are far from the democratic peace that has been imagined by the students of international relations.

This course aims to nail down some of the basic issues that had been argued in the current research on peace and security. The questions are all deceptively simple enough, but then the answers will all be ambiguous at best. It is my hope that you will be able to provide better answers than those given in the course by developing your own analytical capacity.

Course Syllabus
The course is divided into four parts: 

Week 1: When is War Necessary, raises the question of military intervention in light of theories of just war.

Week 2: Power Transition and War, discusses the argument that global transitions in power distribution lead to hegemonic wars. 

Week 3: Democratic Peace, Democratic Wars, is a reappraisal of the democratic peace theory, and asks if democratization by force provides international security. 

Week 4: Conditions for Peace, is directed toward our new assessment of paths toward durable peace.

An introduction to the life and work of Andy Warhol, one of the world’s most famous artists, through exploration of five thematic framings of his life and career: celebrity; sex; money; death; and time.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This course will introduce you to the life and work of Andy Warhol, one of the world’s most famous artists. It will:

Explore why Warhol has international standing both within and beyond the art establishment;
Examine how artistic worth and value is constructed and attributed;
Interrogate some of Warhol’s main thematic concerns and major creative innovations;
Position Warhol in relation to major artistic movements of the 20th century (Dada, minimalism, Pop Art, structuralism, etc).
This course has been developed as part of the ARTIST ROOMS research partnership between the University of Edinburgh, Tate, and the National Galleries of Scotland. It is delivered by staff and teaching assistants based in History of Art and the School of Design at ECA.



Course Syllabus
Week 1: Celebrity

Subjects to be explored will include:

Warhol’s early investment in stars and celebrities, as seen (for example) in his early illustrations of James Dean;
Warhol’s screenprints of stars, based on mass media images: Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, Jackie Kennedy, etc. The connection often made between these screenprints and Walter Benjamin’s arguments about ‘art in the age of mass reproduction’ will be examined;
Warhol’s creation of his own group of ‘superstars’, especially through his filmmaking activities;
Warhol as a celebrity in his own right;
Creation of Interview magazine;
Warhol’s move from the subcultural scene in the 1960s to mainstream celebrity circles in the 1980s.
 

Week 2: Sex

‘After being alive, the next hardest work is having sex. […] It’s just as much work for an attractive person not to have sex as for an unattractive person to have sex…’ (The Philosophy of Andy Warhol).

Subjects to be explored will include:

The common misconception of Warhol as an asexual machine;
The regular appearance of homoerotic imagery throughout Warhol’s work: line drawings of boys; genital photography portraits; ‘tease’ content of films such as My Hustler and Blow Job;
Coded sexual content in seemingly banal material (e.g., the World’s Fair mural Thirteen Most Wanted Men);
Warhol and censorship.
 

Week 3: Money

‘Business art is the step that comes after Art. I started as a commercial artist, and I want to finish as a business artist. After I did the thing called “art” or whatever it’s called, I went into business art. I wanted to be an Art Businessman or a Business Artist. Being good in business is the most fascinating kind of art. During the hippie era people put down the idea of business – they’d say, “Money is bad”, and “Working is bad”, but making money is art and working is art and good business is the best art.’ (The Philosophy of Andy Warhol)

 

Subjects to be explored will include:

The value of Warhol’s art in the market;
The shifting value of some of Warhol’s work (such as his photography);
Warhol’s use of cheap household products (Brillo pads, soup cans, comic books, etc) as the basis for works of art;
The beginnings of Warhol’s career as a window dresser, and as a commercial artist;
Warhol’s own arguments about money and commercial art.
 

Week 4: Death

Subjects to be explored will include:

The Death and Disaster series of screenprints;
Death as a significant component of Warhol’s portraits of Marilyn Monroe and Jackie Kennedy;
Valerie Solanas’ attempted assassination of Warhol in 1968, and the impact this had on his work;
Accusations for the deaths of such Factory figures as Freddy Herko and Edie Sedgwick;
Echoes of mortality in Warhol’s later works, including screenprints of guns and skulls, self-portraits with skulls, etc;
Arguments by Thomas Crow (‘Saturday Disasters’) and Stephen Koch (Stargazer) about the centrality of death in Warhol’s work.
 

Week 5: Time

Subjects to be explored will include:

The lasting status of Warhol’s most iconic works, including how such iconicity is established;
The rate of operation in Warhol’s studio: fierce fabrication speeds;
Stillness and slowness in some of Warhol’s films and photographs, such as Empire and the Screen Tests series;
Warhol’s Time Capsules;
Repetition and difference as central tropes in Warhol’s work.

Recommended Background
No background required.

Suggested Readings
There is no set text for this course, but recommendations will be made each week that relate to the theme being explored.

For those new to studying Warhol, Wayne Koestenbaum&#39;s biography Andy Warhol provides a thorough introduction to the artist. For those interested in Warhol&#39;s films, the introduction to Glyn Davis and Gary Needham&#39;s Warhol in Ten Takes provides a comprehensive overview of this aspect of his career and output.
Course Format
This course will be delivered in five thematic blocks of material, which allow distinct framings of Warhol’s life, career, and work. The five themes are: celebrity; sex; money; death; and time.

FAQ
Will I get a certificate after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.

It is now clear that without action on climate change, the world may become 4°C warmer by the end of this century. Such an increase would threaten to roll back decades of development progress; thus, we are at a ‘make it or break it’ point in time. This course presents the most recent scientific evidence, as well as some of the opportunities for urgent action.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
Under current pledges and commitments, the world is likely to reach 4°C degree warming by the end of the century and 2°C warming as early as 2040. This MOOC brings together renowned scientists to provide a synthesis of the most recent scientific evidence and presents an analysis of likely impacts and risks, with a focus on developing countries. It chronicles already observed changes in the climate system and their impacts, through the increase in carbon dioxide emissions, corresponding temperature increases and melting of glaciers and sea ice, and changes in precipitation patterns. This course also offers projections for the 21st century for droughts, heat waves and sea-level rise, with implications for food and water security, as well as possible impacts on agriculture, water availability, ecosystems and human health. 

This MOOC presents an analysis of the likely impacts of a 4°C warming trajectory and stresses the need for decision makers and communities to take a serious look at their adaptation choices, while also signaling the urgency for mitigation action. Participants will also be introduced to the risks of triggering non-linearity, and tipping elements, such as the disintegration of the West Antarctic ice sheet and large-scale Amazon dieback. The course ends with a discussion of the main policy choices needed to prevent warming above 2°C.

Overview 
This overview presents the main topics this course will cover, and provides a summary of the key impacts and challenges of a 4°C warmer world. 

Week 1: Observed Climate Changes and Impacts: Hundreds of Thousands of Years to Now 
This module outlines the historical observed changes in the climate system leading up to the present day and the impacts that can now be attributed to human-induced climate change. It examines the rise of greenhouse gas emissions since preindustrial times, while explaining the link between CO2 concentrations and the rising global mean temperature, ocean heat storage and sea-level rise, as well as uncertainties in the scientific evidence. It also describes the trends of increasing loss of ice in Greenland and Antarctica, increasing loss of Arctic sea ice, melting mountain glaciers, increased heat waves and extreme temperatures, and drought and aridity trends. 

Week 2: Possible 21st Century Climates 
This module provides an overview of the projected changes in climate leading up to the end of the 21st century. It describes the likelihood of a 4°C warmer world by 2100 AD and enables a deeper understanding of various climate models with different projections and key areas of uncertainty. It also reviews possible responses from natural systems, explaining how the projected climatic changes from 2°C to 4°C warming could result in sea-level rise, heat waves and extreme temperatures, and ocean acidification. 

Week 3: Life in a 4°C Warmer World 
a) Impacts Across Key Human Support Systems 
This module presents an overview of current and projected climate impacts across key human support systems, such as agriculture and food production, water resources, ecosystems and biodiversity, and human health. Each of these human support systems will be negatively impacted by climate change under a 4°C warming scenario, resulting in adverse consequences for development, such as: diminishing crop yields, which threaten food production and human health; loss of biodiversity; the spread of vector-borne diseases; and water scarcity. 

b) Risks of Large-Scale and Disruptive Changes in the Climate System 
This module brings together information from earlier modules, by considering how the impacts of, risks from and vulnerabilities to climate change may scale with increasing levels of CO2 concentrations and global mean warming. It highlights the risks of nonlinear and cascading impacts and the risk of crossing critical thresholds for nonlinear tipping elements of the Earth system, which could dramatically increase vulnerability to climate change and impose multiple stresses on development. 

Week 4: What Can We Do About It? The Choice Is in Your Hands (Discussion) 
After having outlined the scientific evidence in previous modules, this final module goes beyond the Turn Down the Heat report and provides a discussion on what mitigation and adaptation action is needed to help avoid a 4°C world, while also decreasing vulnerability to climate change impacts and building climate resilience. Since no single solution exists, this module will share perspectives from a range of actors on a range of key policy measures and climate actions. Track 1 (for the general public) will showcase how different lifestyles may affect changes in the climate and explore everyday choices that can help mitigate climate change and decrease vulnerability to its impacts. Track 2 (for policymakers) invites leaders from various countries, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and civil society to exchange ideas and examples of effective policies and actions that can help in the transition towards a low-emissions and climate-resilient development path.

Depending on your particular interest, you can choose to participate in one of two tracks as an optional activity.
Track 1: Climate Champions
Track 2: Policy and Leadership

 	Track 1	Track 2
Target Audience	The ‘Climate Champions’ track is suitable for anyone with an interest in climate change, and provides more insight into the science behind climate change and opportunities to further expand your knowledge of key areas.	The ‘Policy and Leadership’ track involves connecting with others in similar positions (e.g., policymakers, provincial and national government personnel, representatives of civil society, academia) around the world, and developing new networks of practice around climate change issues.
Common objective	To understand observed changes in the climate system, their causes and immediate consequences, and projected medium- to long-term impacts on development
Track-specific objectives	 To describe the climate context under the current level of 0.8° warming and recognize how projected changes in climate (under 2°C to 4°C warming) could affect such sectors as agriculture, water resources, ecosystems and health

To realize how your lifestyle contributes to changes in the climate system and outline the actions you can take to reduce your climate impact or carbon footprint	 To critically interpret different climate projections and recognize how these changes in climate (under 2°C to 4°C warming as opposed to a current warming level of 0.8°C) could affect such sectors as agriculture, water resources, ecosystems and human health

To discuss and distinguish between suitable policy options that countries/organizations need to take to help mitigate and adapt to climate change
Assignments	
Assignments focus on facilitating a basic understanding of the science.
You will learn how to apply the knowledge you have gained to your everyday lives.
Assignments focus mostly on policy intervention for sectors that need urgent climate action, and connecting with others in similar positions.
You will be able to apply the knowledge you have gained to your specific country and policy context.

The Paradox of War teaches us to understand that war is not only a normal part of human existence, but is arguably one of the most important factors in making us who we are. Through this course, I hope that you will come to appreciate that war is both a natural expression of common human emotions and interactions and a constitutive part of how we cohere as groups. That is, war is paradoxically an expression of our basest animal nature and the exemplar of our most vaunted and valued civilized virtues. You will learn some basic military history and sociology in this course as a lens for the more important purpose of seeing the broader social themes and issues related to war. I want you to both learn about war, but more importantly, use it as way of understanding your everyday social world So, for example, the discussion of war and gender will serve to start you thinking about how expectations of masculinity are created and our discussion of nationalism will make clear how easy “us-them” dichotomies can be established and (ab)used. I will suggest some readings for you to complement the class and assign some activities through which you will be able to apply the theoretical insights from the course to your observations of everyday life. At the end of the course, you will start to see war everywhere and come to appreciate how much it defines our life.

This course will examine current conditions and trends in water and sanitation services in low and middle income countries. Within it we will take a critical look at the underlying political, economic, social, and technical reasons why almost a billion people lack access to improved water supplies and almost 2 billion still do not have improved sanitation services.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This first module in the two module course sequence critically examines the consequences of current water and sanitation conditions, including over 2 million deaths annually due to water-related diseases, millions of dollars in avoidable health care expenditures, and billions of hours spent carrying water from sources outside the home. Reducing such costs associated with poor water and sanitation services is one of the major challenges for States in the low and middle income countries in the 21st century. The technologies to provide networked water and sanitation services are well-known, as are many low-cost, non-network solutions that would appear affordable to many poor households in developing countries. For decades the international community and national governments have struggled to find institutional and financial arrangements to provide these technologies to households and businesses in developing countries, with mixed success. Although progress is being made in many parts of the world, millions of households in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia still face a lifetime without the improved water and sanitation services that citizens in industrialized countries take for granted.

The second module will focus on what can be done to solve global water and sanitation problems. We will examine the main strategies that donors and national governments have tried to change status quo water and sanitation conditions, and the lessons learned from these experiences.

A survey of the history of economic development in the world in the past 300 years.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
If you had been alive at the start of the eighteenth century, your material well-being would have been much the same whichever region of the world you lived in, and it would almost certainly have been a precarious existence.  Go back 300 years before the eighteenth century, and not much was different.  But come forward 300 years to the present, and we see a startling transformation.

Incomes in some parts of the world have increased more than ten-fold; and now it most certainly does matter where you live – with income differentials of 50 times between the world’s richest and poorest countries.  What has changed in the past 300 years is the development and application of new technologies at a pace unprecedented in human history – the steam engine, electricity and the computer, to name just a few.  With these developments, for those who have access to them, have come huge gains in living standards.

In this course we’ll explore the spectacular (but uneven) story of economic development – beginning with the Malthusian era, moving on to the take-off of growth in the Industrial Revolution and the Great Divergence in living standards that followed, and finishing in the present with the Global Financial Crisis.  We’ll cover the main episodes and events in the development of the world economy in the past 300 years, and have something to say about most regions of the world.  As well as dealing with ‘what happened’, the course will emphasise what is known about ‘why’ – and what lessons historical experience can provide for understanding how some countries today are so rich yet others remain so poor.

	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This course explores the history of the modern world since Chinggis Khan. It focuses on the connections between societies from the time of the Mongol conquests and the gradual, but accelerating ways in which connections became ties of inter-dependence. The relations between societies are what will concern us. The forces pulling the world together vary from religious to economic, political to intellectual. These forces bring the world together, but they also create new divisions. Nowadays, we call this &quot;globalization.&quot; That term has tended to emphasize the drive to worldwide integration; the view of globalization taken in this course emphasizes disintegration as well as integration. We will tackle some very basic questions: How do we explain the staggering wealth of China in the centuries up to 1750, as well as China&#39;s recent ascent? Where did the United States come from, and where is it headed? What are the significance and legacies of empire in the world? How have world wars and revolutions shaped the international system over time? What exactly is globalization, and how does today&#39;s globalization compare with the past? How has the relationship between humans and nature changed over the centuries?

	<field name="course_intro">Women and the Civil Rights Movement
Learn about women’s roles in the U.S. civil rights struggles of the 1890s to the 1990s.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
This course examines the U.S. civil rights movement from the vantage point of women, considering both women’s involvement in the legal campaigns and political protests and the impact of civil rights struggles on women’s status and identity.  Taking a “long civil rights movement” perspective, we begin in the late nineteenth century and consider events, organizations, and personalities through the twentieth century. 

Throughout we will consider issues which have preoccupied historians, social movement theorists, and historians alike:  developing and sustaining political commitment, assessing the strengths and weaknesses of various forms of political organization, maximizing influence and securing long-range objectives.  We will also examine competing definitions of leadership; class, race, and gender dynamics within the movement; and the cultural dynamics of political organizing and social change.  

In the process, we consider not only how the movement altered the status of African Americans in the U.S. but the legacy of these struggles as they changed understandings of citizenship and rights more broadly.   Our concern throughout the course will be to not only understand the historical narrative but also to see how historians work to make sense of the past.
Recommended Background
There is no prerequisite but the course will be conducted at the level expected of advanced undergraduates.  
Suggested Readings
The course includes significant reading of primary historical documents of the civil rights movement and historians’ analyses.
Course Format
Each week I will offer a series of video discussions, including an analytical overview of the week’s topics and themes and shorter case studies of specific activists, organizations, events.  I will also offer video discussions of the major readings.  There will be weekly quizzes and throughout the course students will be asked to write short essays offering insights into the reading.  After a student has submitted an essay, the student will be given access to the essays written by several fellow students and be asked to read and comment on those.  The course will include an optional online forum where students may raise questions about the historical material and engage the contemporary implications of our discussions of citizenship, rights, and political organizing.  The forum will be monitored and in some cases I will reply in the forum or post a supplementary video clip for the class based on issues raised in the forum.</field>

	<field name="course_intro">Listening to World Music
Learn the ideas and vocabulary for listening to world music, and examine the music of several world music cultures and how they have entered into mainstream popular culture.</field>
	<field name="course_body">About the Course
With the click of a mouse, now more than ever we are able to access sounds made by people from all around the world. And yet, most of us don&#39;t listen to the wide diversity of music available to us, probably because it sounds so strange. This class will open up the world of music to you. We begin with a brief history of recording technology, the music industry and the place of world music in that narrative; you are introduced to keywords for talking about music cross-culturally; and then proceed to half a dozen musical cultures around the world. In each of these musical cultures, we examine the ways in which music works in those distant cultures, how it sounds, what it means, who may perform it; and then we ask ourselves where this music has traveled and entered into the Western popular culture as entertainment, political discourse, or artistic purpose.
Course Syllabus
Week One: Introductions with an overview of recording technology history and ties to world music and cultures; vocabulary for talking about world music and global cultural encounters, and a case study of “Chant,” the 1990s Gregorian chant recording that crossed over into the popular music market.
Week Two: Graceland, Paul Simon&#39;s &quot;collaborative&quot; album. We reflect on the two opposite meanings of the word &quot;appropriate,&quot; examine multitrack recording, and consider the &quot;collaborative&quot; process in world music production.
Week Three: Tuvan Throat Singers, we examine how nomadic pastoralists from the Russian republic called Tanna Tuva have become world music superstars because of a single field recording made by an ethnomusicologist in the late 1980s.
Week Four: Pygmy Pop? We discuss &quot;pygmies&quot; in the western imagination, and uses of &quot;pygmy&quot; music in northern hemisphere popular culture to ask about the ethics of recorded music appropriations.
Week Five: Australian Aboriginal group Yothu Yindi embraced a discourse of cultural and musical reconciliation, and mixed the language of rock with traditional sounds as a successful political strategy in the 1990s.
Week Six: Kalahari Bushmen or Khoisan, are perhaps the oldest existing human communities. We discuss their traditional music, the 1970s Gods Must Be Crazy commercial film, and appropriation and reclamation of Khoisan heritage by South Africans in post-apartheid South Africa.
Week Seven: Cuba, the 1990s Buena Vista Social Club sound recording and documentary film, and a brief discussion of Cuban contemporary history and music are the subject of this final class.
Recommended Background
Though it may be useful, you are not required to have any music theoretical knowledge to take the class.  You will learn not just about “music” as absolute sound, but about how music works in particular communities, and as a globally distributed, and often politically contested, entity.
Suggested Readings
There is no single book published on this material, though reference is made to scholarly literature and recordings in the course of each lecture.
Course Format
The class will consist of lecture videos and discussions of youtube music clips, which are between 8 and 15 minutes in length. Video clips contain an integrated quiz question or short matching quiz.  There will also be standalone homework discussion forums that are not part of video lectures, and a (not optional) final exam.
FAQ
Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?
Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.

What do I need for the class?
An inquiring mind and ears open to hearing a wide range of sound. Access to Youtube.

What is meant by “world music”?
World Music is a marketing category created by the music industry in the late 1980s for music not traditionally considered “mainstream” by the industry. The term doesn’t mean we will cover all of the world’s music in 7 weeks. Rather we focus briefly on a handful of musical cultures to examine ways in which music has been harnessed by communities and individuals in the contemporary world for a variety of purposes.

Does it matter that I don’t have any music theoretical knowledge? Will I need to be able to notate music?
No. You will learn to listen to, and discuss the music you hear in several ways. Graduate students from the University of Pennsylvania provide examples of how they hear the music, to encourage you to do similarly. You are given basic musical vocabulary relevant to each unit.

What resources will I need for this class?
All musical examples used in the class come from Youtube, though there are many online resources you may know yourselves for locating musical examples that are either free or available for a small fee. We will make reference to a range of recordings and films that you may wish to locate and view in your own time. It will be an added bonus if you know about and inform other students in the class about further resources on a subject or community discussed in this course.

What is the coolest thing I&#39;ll learn if I take this class?
Your ears will open to new sounds, your mind to new understanding of these sounds, your playlist will grow, and you will expand your knowledge of the world through its extraordinary range of music.

How do I connect with the course on social media?You can join the Listening to World Music student community on Facebook, follow the course on Twitter, or add it to your circles on Google+.
