Cash versus accrual accounting
Just keeping track of cash that goes in and out of a business doesn&#39;t always reflect what&#39;s going on. This tutorial compares cash and accrual accounting. Very valuable if you ever plan on starting or investing in any type of business (you might also discover a nascent passion for accounting)!
Cash accounting
Accrual basis of accounting
Comparing accrual and cash accounting
Three core financial statements
Corporations use three financial statements to report what&#39;s going on: balance sheets, cash flow statements and income statements. They can be derived from each other and each give a valuable lens on the operations and condition of a business. After you know the basics of accrual accounting (available in another tutorial), this tutorial will give you tools you need to responsibly understand any business.

Depreciation and amortization
How do you account for things that get &quot;used up&quot; or a cost that should be spread over time. This tutorial has your answer. Depreciation and amortization might sound fancy, but you&#39;ll hopefully find them to be quite understandable.

Inflation basics
$1 went a lot further in 1900 than today (you could probably buy a good meal for the family for $1 back then). Why? And how do we measure how much more expensive things have gotten (i.e., inflation)?
Inflation overview
What is inflation
Inflation data
CPI index
Inflation scenarios
You know about inflation, but now want to look at how thing might play out in different scenarios. This tutorial focuses on when inflation is &quot;acceptable&quot; and when it isn&#39;t (and the causes and repercussions).
Moderate inflation in a good economy
Stagflation
Hyperinflation
Real and nominal return
If the value of money is constantly changing, can we compare investment return in the future or past to that earned in the present? This tutorial focuses on how to do this (another good tutorial to watch is the one on &quot;present value&quot;).
Real and nominal return
Calculating real return in last year dollars
Relation between nominal and real returns and inflation
Capacity utilization and inflation
This tutorial starts with a very &quot;micro&quot; view of when firms decide to raise (or lower prices). It then jumps back to the macro view to discuss how capacity utilization can impact prices.

Prices don&#39;t always go up. They often go down. This might seem like a good thing, but it could be disastrous for a modern economy is it goes too far. This tutorial explains what deflation is, how it happens and what the effects of it might be.

Mutual funds and ETFs
If we&#39;re not in the mood to research and pick our own stocks, mutual funds and/or ETFs might be a good option. This tutorial explains what they are and how they are different.

Retirement accounts: IRAs and 401ks
The government apparently wants us to save for retirement (not always obvious because it also wants us to spend as much as possible to pump the economy going into the next election cycle). To encourage this, it has created some ways to save that avoid or defer taxes: IRAs and 401ks.
Traditional IRAs
Roth IRAs
401(k)s
Life insurance
It is a bit of a downer to think about, but we are all going to die. Do we care what happens to our loved ones (if they really are &quot;loved&quot; than the answer is obvious). This tutorial walks us through the options to insure our families against losing us. The reason why we stuck it in the &quot;investment vehicles&quot; topic is because it can also be an investment that we can use before we die.

Hedge funds
Hedge funds have absolutely nothing to do with shrubbery. Their name comes from the fact that early hedge funds (and some current ones) tried to &quot;hedge&quot; their exposure to the market (so they could, in theory, do well in an &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot; market as long as they were good at picking the good companies). Today, hedge funds represent a huge class investment funds. They are far less regulated than, say, mutual funds. In exchange for this, they aren&#39;t allowed to market or take investments from &quot;unsophisticated&quot; investors. Some use their flexibility to mitigate risk, other use it to amplify it.

This tutorial walks through the mechanics and why--assuming management isn&#39;t doing something stupid--the shares might not be diluted at all.

Marginal propensity to consume (MPC)
If you earn a $1, you might spend some fraction of it. This can then be income for someone else. This can keep going. In this tutorial, we&#39;ll explore how the incremental spend per incremental earnings (marginal propensity to consume) and the multiplier effect based on it can drive economic activity.
MPC and multiplier
Mathy version of MPC and multiplier (optional)
Consumption function
We are steadily building up the tools to understand the Keynesian Cross and the IS-LM model. In this tutorial, we begin to model consumption as a linear function of disposable income. Seems reasonable to me.
Consumption function basics
Generalized linear consumption function
Consumption function with income dependent taxes
Keynesian cross
We now build on our consumption function models and start to explore ideas of planned expenditures as a function of output. When plotted with the actual output line, we get our Keynesian Cross which helps us think about whether the economy is operating at its potential.
Keynesian cross
Details on shifting aggregate planned expenditures
Keynesian cross and the multiplier
IS-LM model
In this tutorial, we begin thinking about the impact of real interest rates on planned investment and output. We then use this to help us plot the IS curve. We then think about how, assuming a fixed money supply, as there is more economic activity, people are willing to pay more for money (helps us plot the LM curve). Finally, we use the IS-LM model to think about how fiscal policy can impact both GDP and real interest rates. You should watch the Keynesian Cross tutorial before this one.

Fractional reserve banking
Most modern economies use a counter-intuitive model of banking called &quot;fractional reserve banking.&quot; It is counter-intuitive (and some people would say wrong) because it allows banks to lend out money that it tells depositors is available at any time and essentially involves private banks in money creation. It also creates the possibility of mass instability through bank runs that tend to be mitigated through government regulation and insurance (some would say government subsidy of banks). This tutorial explains how fractional reserve lending works and outlines the good and bad. It also talks about the alternative of full reserve banking.

Money supply
This short tutorial explains how we measure how much &quot;money&quot; there is out there. As we&#39;ll see, this isn&#39;t as straightforward as counting dollars in people&#39;s pockets, especially because there are multiple type of money.

Renaissance art: Introduction
Burgundy
No, not the color and not the wine! In the 15th century, the duchy of Burgundy was one of the most powerful regions in Europe, and stretched from what is today central France up to what is today Belgium and Holland. The home of the Dukes of Burgundy was Dijon, and Duke Philip the Bold commissioned some of the century&#39;s greatest works there, including a Carthusian monastery just outside the city walls, where he hoped to be buried so the monks could pray for his soul for eternity. He hired some of the most brilliant artists in Europe to work for him there, including Claus Sluter. Very little of the monastery survives today, but thankfully Sluter’s great work, The Well of Moses, can still be seen there.

Flanders
In the 15th century, Flanders (which is the northern portion of Belgium today) was ruled by the Dukes of Burgundy. The enormous wealth of the court of the Dukes and the wealth of the merchant class (in the thriving cities of Bruges and Tournai) made for a new interest in art that mimicked the material world, though in a way that was quite different from what was happening concurrently in Florence. Oil paint comes into its own in the work of Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden, and we see how the artists of the North used it to create stunning illusions of fur, wood, wool, glass, and jewels.

Florence
Walking through the streets of Florence in the summer isn’t always easy, it’s jam packed with students and tourists who have come to study and admire the city’s treasures including Michelangelo’s David, Botticelli’s Birth of Venus, and the engineering brilliance of Brunelleschi. Florence in the 15th Century was fabulously wealthy thanks to its banking and manufacturing families. The Medici, the de-facto rulers of the city, were bankers who commissioned some of the most important art of the Renaissance. Florence was also a center of the Humanist revival that in many ways is what separates our Modern world from the Medieval era.

Venice
Renaissance Venice was a city of merchants that traded with the Byzantine and Islamic Empires to the East, with the Germanic nations North of the Alps, and with Kingdoms to the West. In the 15th Century, Venice was at the height of its power with colonies and a well equipped navy to protect its merchant fleet abroad. Its fabulous wealth financed the construction of sumptuous churches and palaces—and art to fill them. The city’s salty, humid air meant that frescos faded quickly and so in the late 15th century, artists adopted oil, a medium they had seen used on panels from the north. By the late 15th century, they had also adopted canvas as their support of choice and artists like Giovanni Bellini created some of the most subtle and engaging art ever made.

Tyrol
Currently this tutorial contains the work of only one artist, Michael Pacher. It would have been so much easier if we could have included him in Venice, since Pacher was influenced by the work of the great Venetian painter Mantegna. But Pacher spoke German, and the specific area he was from (today in the north-east of Italy), was known as Tyrol (though there is a state of Tyrol today in Austria). Confusing, we know. In this tutorial, we take a look at Pacher’s amazing St. Wolfgang Altarpiece which is still in the church it was made for—a church on a lake surrounded by mountains in Austria, still visited by religious pilgrims. Most altarpieces in the Renaissance were made of many interconnected panels that were later sold and ended up in different collections, and this means that to see one altarpiece you usually have to travel to many museums. But this is not true of the St. Wolfgang altarpiece. Seeing a Renaissance work of art in the space it was made for helps us to travel back in time to the late 15th Century.

High Renaissance: Florence and Rome
We don’t call this the “High” Renaissance for nothing! This period sees hugely ambitious projects, from Michelangelo’s painting of the Sistine Chapel ceiling and the rebuilding of St. Peter’s in Rome, to Raphael’s frescoes in the papal palace. We use this term to refer to the art of the Italian Renaissance, beginning with Leonardo, whose great masterpiece the Last Supper, actually dates to the last decades of the 15th century (history is never neat!). In the painting and sculpture of this period, ideally beautiful figures who move gracefully, often in complex, multi-figure compositions conveying the sense that human beings are an echo of the perfection of God.

The High Renaissance in Florence and Rome
Venice
The light is different in Venice, the sun glints off the city’s watery streets illuminating Renaissance palaces and churches filled with the art of Bellini, Giorgione, Tintoretto, Veronese and Titian. Perhaps due to the complex play of light reflected off the canals and Byzantine mosaics, Venetian art is known for its brilliant color and subtle tone. The great Venetian artists produced many of the most important paintings of the Renaissance, but their work was different from their colleagues in Florence and Rome who found inspiration in ancient ruins. The Venetians favored the sumptuous, the exotic and the poetic and created art for a society that had grown wealthy trading with distant lands.

The Renaissance in Venice in the 1500s
Mannerism
You could say that High Renaissance painters had achieved it all—ideally beautiful, graceful figures, rational spaces, and unified compositions with dozens of figures. If you were a young artist in the early decades of the 1500s you might have felt that there was nothing left to accomplish! Renaissance art was always based on the visual world—on representing things as we see them, but Mannerist art was more artificial, it looked to other art rather than to nature, and Mannerist artists purposely looked for complexity and difficulty to showcase their skills. Figures are elongated, the illusion of space that was so important for the Renaissance no longer makes sense, and the human body is often impossibly twisted.

Northern Renaissance
The Renaissance in the North continues, but now with the impact of the Protestant Reformation, where there was growing concern that images in the church violated the commandment against making likenesses, as part of the prohibition against worshipping idols. The Reformation had a direct impact on some of the greatest painters of this period, including the German artists Durer, who converted, and Cranach, who was a close friend of Luther. There was increasing exchange during this period between artists in Italy and those in Northern Europe in terms of both methods and style, though the two styles remain distinct. Here we see some of the most complex painting in the work of Holbein, some of the most playful in the work of Bruegel and some of the most terrifying in the work of Bosch.

The Protestant Reformation
In 1517 a German theologian and monk, Martin Luther, challenged the authority of the Pope and sparked the Protestant Reformation. His ideas spread quickly, thanks in part to the printing press. By challenging the power of the Church, and asserting the authority of individual conscience (it was increasingly possible for people to read the bible in the language that they spoke), the Reformation laid the foundation for the value that modern culture places on the individual.

Italy
Baroque painting, sculpture and architecture in Italy seems to miraculously unite the heavenly and the earthly to deepen the faith of believers. We’ll look at the utterly convincing illusions of heaven on the painted ceilings of Il Gesu and St. Ignazio, and the way Caravaggio painted biblical scenes with a gritty realism that makes them look as though they are taking place on the streets of Rome. And of course we explore the great genius of the period, Bernini, who used every means at his disposal—painting, sculpture and architecture—in works like The Ecstasy of St. Theresa and the Cathedra Petri to bring the viewer closer to the divine.

Flanders
This tutorial focuses on the art of Peter Paul Rubens, whose work was in high demand by nearly every King, Queen and aristocrat in Catholic Europe (good thing he had a huge workshop!). Rubens was a master of color, dramatic compositions, and movement. Although he was from Northern Europe, he traveled to Italy and absorbed the art of the Renaissance, of classical antiquity, and of Caravaggio. He painted nearly every type of subject—landscapes, portraits, mythology, and history paintings.

Holland
In the Protestant Dutch Republic of the 17th century there was an enormous demand for art from a wide cross-section of the public. This was a very good thing, since the institution that had been the main patron for art—the Church—was no longer in the business of commissioning art due to the Protestant Reformation. Dutch artists sought out new subjects of interest to their new clientele, scenes of everyday life (genre paintings), landscapes and still-lifes. There was also an enormous market for portraits. One of the greatest artist of this period, Rembrandt, made his name as a portrait painter, but was also a printmaker, and his work also includes moving interpretations of biblical subjects (though from a Protestant perspective).

Spain
The main focus of this tutorial, and a leading artist at this time is the great Diego Velazquez, who spent most of his career as the court painter to the King of Spain painting official portraits. But in the hands of Velazquez, even mundane portraits became masterpieces of brushwork and color. His early work was influenced by the realism of Caravaggio. Get up close to the princess in his later masterpiece, Las Meninas (The Maids of Honor), and you’ll see broad brushstrokes of red, pink, black and white, but step back and they magically resolve to create a perfect illusion of the silk of her dress and the light moving across her face and hair. No other artist, except perhaps Titian and Rubens, revealed so honestly the alchemy of painting—how paint can be turned into reality.

France
In France, the LeNain Brothers painted scenes of every-day life (genre paintings), often depicting peasants. There was a renewal of interest in their art in the mid-Nineteenth Century, when the art critic, Champfluery wrote that the brothers “considered men in tatters more interesting than courtiers in embroidered garments.” At the same time, Poussin created a very different style—one that was highly intellectual and looked back to Renaissance, and ancient Greek and Roman art.

Rococo
It’s hard not to like Rococo art. After all, it’s subjects are often about luxury and pleasure, which makes sense since its patrons were the extremely wealthy French aristocracy. This tutorial features two romantic liaisons—Fragonard’s The Swing and The Meeting, portraits and a mythological subject, “Venus Consoling Love.” You get the idea.

Neo-Classicism
Jacques Louis David, an active supporter of the Revolution of 1789, is the star of this tutorial. David served in the revolutionary government, used his art in the service of its cause—and voted to behead King Louis XVI. He captured the patriotism of the revolution’s early phase and later, memorialized its dead heroes. And when the revolution failed, and Napoleon came to power, David used his great talents to present a heroic image of that military general-turned emperor. David invents a new style for the democratic values of the Enlightenment—one that is the very opposite of the luxuriousness of the Rococo—and that looks back to Renaissance and ancient Greek art, hence the name—Neo-Classicism (new classicism).

Britain &amp; America in the Age of Revolution
Britain and America in the Age of Revolutions (Reynolds, Copley, Peale) It was hard to be an artist in America during the colonial period, and for decades after too. There were no real art schools, no grand tradition of art, and no wealthy aristocratic patrons to commission heroic subjects. Americans were practical, and they wanted portraits—and not paintings of classical mythology (which didn’t always make American artists, at least those with wider ambitions, happy). As you’ll learn in this tutorial, Copley was the greatest American portrait painter of the period, and Peale, who studied with Copley, painted portraits of American heroes such as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin, and founded what became the first real American art museum. American artists looked to England for support and inspiration, often to the older Sir Joshua Reynolds, who was the painter to the King, and first President of the Royal Academy in London.

Romanticism in France
Romanticism begins in France with the violent and exotic battle scenes of Gros and the famous shipwreck, the Raft of the Medusa, painted by Gericault. Soon after, two distinct trends emerge in French painting, one—represented by the artist Delacroix—was rebellious, and emphasized emotion, color and loose brushwork. The other—which can be seen in the art of Ingres—upheld tradition, and emphasized line and a highly finished surface. Of course, things were more complicated—but those were battle lines!

The great artist Francisco Goya is the focus of this tutorial. Goya began his career designing tapestries for the royal residences, and eventually became court painter to the King of Spain. But after Napoleon’s army occupied Spain and deposed the King, Goya documented the horrors he witnessed. His work following the occupation, including the Third of May 1808, remains some of the most powerful anti-war images ever created. His later years were spent largely in a house outside Madrid which he painted with haunting scenes. Saturn Devouring his sons belongs to this late series, known as the “Black Paintings.”

Romanticism in England
As the industrial revolution transformed the British countryside, replacing fields with factories, painters turned to landscape. Constable painted his native suffolk, where he spent his childhood, and imbued it with a sense of affection for rural life. Turner, on the other hand, created dramatic and sublime landscapes with a sense of the heroic or even the tragic. What both of these artists have in common is a desire to make landscape painting—understood as a low subject by the Academy which dictated official views on art—carry serious meaning.

This tutorial focuses exclusively on the art of Caspar David Friedrich, whose work best exemplifies Romanticism’s interest in the big questions of man’s mortality and place in the universe. The world had changed dramatically since the time of Michelangelo, Bernini and Rembrandt, and as a result, Friedrich approached these big questions without the Christian narratives that dominated the art of the past. And like his English counterparts during this period, he imbues nature and the landscape with symbolic and often spiritual meaning.

	<field name="course_intro">Europe in 1907 was powerful, wealthy and stable. The British Empire was unmatched with huge territories that stretched across the globe. The Austrian-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires remained intact, and the Italians, Germans, Dutch, Spanish and Portuguese retained colonies. Nevertheless, the old order would soon collapse, a result of the Great War in 1914. But this trauma was only the beginning. A global financial collapse precipitated by the stock market crash of 1929 allowed Mussolini, Franco and Hitler to seize power. The violence only worsened with the Holocaust, Japanese Imperial expansion, and the Second World War. At the same time, this was a period of radical advances in music (Stravinsky, Bartok, etc.), in dance (Duncan, Graham, etc.) in literature (Joyce, Pound, etc.), science (Einstein, Heisenberg, etc.), and of course, in art (Matisse, Picasso, etc.). In the years between the wars artists explored abstraction and the irrational. After the war, and with Europe in ruins, the focus of the art world shifted from Paris to New York where Abstract Expressionism was born.</field>

The Austrian-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires remained intact, and the Italians, Germans, Dutch, Spanish and Portuguese retained colonies. Nevertheless, the old order would soon collapse, a result of the Great War in 1914. But this trauma was only the beginning. A global financial collapse precipitated by the stock market crash of 1929 allowed Mussolini, Franco and Hitler to seize power. The violence only worsened with the Holocaust, Japanese Imperial expansion, and the Second World War. At the same time, this was a period of radical advances in music (Stravinsky, Bartok, etc.), in dance (Duncan, Graham, etc.) in literature (Joyce, Pound, etc.), science (Einstein, Heisenberg, etc.), and of course, in art (Matisse, Picasso, etc.). In the years between the wars artists explored abstraction and the irrational. After the war, and with Europe in ruins, the focus of the art world shifted from Paris to New York where Abstract Expressionism was born.

Expressionism
Wild Beasts! Les Fauve (wild beasts) is what one critic called the brilliant expressive canvases of Matisse and other artists who exhibited together in 1905. This tutorial traces the work of Henri Matisse from his early Fauvist work with its jarringly bright colors to the stricter geometries he introduced during the First World War. It also tracks Expressionist developments in Germany and Austria with videos on Kirchner, Kandinsky and Jawlensky, artists who adopted a rough, “primitive” style, and on Egon Schiele’s taut, sexually charged paintings from Vienna.

Cubism and its impact
The Spaniard Picasso changed the way we see the world. He could draw with academic perfection at a very young age but he gave it up in order to create a language of representation suited to the modern world. Together with the French artist George Braque, Picasso undertook an analysis of form and vision that would inspire radical new visual forms across Europe and in America. This tutorial explains the underlying principles of Cubism and the abstract experiments that followed including Italian Futurism, Russian Suprematism, and the Dutch movement, de Stijl.

Dada &amp; Surrealism
Do we know who we really are? What parts of our mind do we know and what parts are hidden from us? Should art only focus on the rational, the conscious, or should we also pay attention to the irrational, the uncanny, the powerful impulses that remain unarticulated and just beyond the reach of our awareness. Dada was born during WWI when poets, artists, and actors, sickened by the violence around them, chose to celebrate the irrational. They created an anti-art that challenged the cultural assumptions that they felt supported the ruling elite that had, in turn, caused the war. In the years after the war, Dada gave way to Surrealism which reinstituted traditional forms of art-making but focused on Freud’s theories of the unconscious.

German art between the wars
Germany was defeated and exhausted in 1918 at the end of WWI. The equally exhausted victors imposed harsh terms on Germany. It was forced to forfeit its overseas colonial possessions, to cede land to its neighbors, and to pay reparations. As demobilized troops returned, German cities filled with unemployed, often maimed veterans. The Socialists briefly seized power and by the early 1920s hyperinflation further destabilized the nation. Neue Sachlichkeit or the New Objectivity cast a cold sharp eye on Modern Germany’s hypocrisy, aggression, and destitution even as extremists on the political right consolidated power. The National Socialists or Nazi Party won the chancellorship in 1933 and quickly used art and architecture as a means build the myth of a pure German people shaped by the land and unsullied by modern industrial culture. This tutorial looks at the ways that competing political ideologies each used art for its own purposes.

International style architecture
Towers of glass and steel from the mid-20th Century suggest, for many people, the rationalization of urban space that dehumanized our cities with empty plazas, rigorous geometries and uniformity. But International style architecture was born of the utopian idea that innovative design could improve the lives millions and its forms recall the clarity and harmony of ancient Greek architecture. This tutorial treats the late work of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Gordon Bunshaft, and Frank Lloyd Wright.

American Modernism
Art had never been especially important in America. Before the Civil War, many of America’s best artists went to Europe and stayed. Even after the war, American artists found little enthusiasm for their work unless it was directly informed by European precedents. By the first years of the 20th Century, a small group of American artists began to paint the gritty streets of New York and were called the Ashcan School for their portrayal of life in the tenements. In 1913 however, the Armory Show exhibited advanced American and European art and helped to create a market for the work of Georgia O’Keeffe and other members of modern galleries like Alfred Steiglitz’s 291 and Peggy Guggenheim’s Art of This Century. During the Great Depression artists such as Grant Wood portrayed rural life in the south and midwest and became known as regionalists while other realists such as Edward Hopper rendered the alienation of the modern city. Meanwhile, Surrealist ideas infused a younger generation of artists’ work in Mexico and the US which would result, by the end of WWII, in the first internationally important American art movement, Abstract Expressionism.

&quot;Let them eat cake!&quot; &quot;No, how about we cut your head off instead!&quot; The French Revolution was ugly, bloody and idealistic. This tutorial covers the beginning of the end of the Bourbon rule (actually doesn&#39;t really go away for 60 years) and birth of France as a Republic (which will really take about 80 years).

Napoleon Bonaparte
A man with such a huge &quot;Napoleonic complex&quot;, that they named it after him. A military genius with a ginormous ego, some people consider him a hero or a tyrant or both. France has successfully overthrown Louis XVI in 1789. It has gone through a many-year period of bloodshed and instability. The monarch&#39;s of Europe are not happy about this &quot;overthrow-your-king&quot; business. A 5&#39;6&#39;&#39; Corsican establishes himself as a strong military tactician during the wars with other European powers and soon comes to power in France. This tutorial covers the rise and fall of one of the most famous men in all of history: Napoleon Bonaparte (Napoleon I).

Yes, you are right. Haiti is not in Europe. We put the tutorial here because it was a French colony and its own revolution is closely linked to that of France&#39;s.

Beginning of World War I
Called the Great War (before World War II came about), World War I was the bloody wake-up call that humanity was entering into a new stage of civilization. Really the defining conflict that took Europe from 19th Century Imperial states that saw heroism in war into a modern shape. Unforunately, it had to go through World War II as well (that some would argue was due to imbalances created by World War I).

Aftermath of World War I
World war I (or the Great War) was a defining event for the 20th Century. It marked the end (or beginning of the end) of centuries-old empires and the dawn-of newly independent states based on ethnic and linguistic commonality. It didn&#39;t just change the face of Europe, it changed the face of the world. From the Paris Peace Conference and Treaty of Versailles, we&#39;ll see how the end of World War I may have been just the set up for even more conflict in Europe and the world.

Function introduction
Relationships can be any association between sets of numbers while functions have only one output for a given input. This tutorial works through a bunch of examples of testing whether something is a valid function. As always, we really encourage you to pause the videos and try the problems before Sal does!

Domain and range
What values can you and can you not input into a function? What values can the function output? The domain is the set of values that the function is defined for (i.e., the values that you can input into a function). The range is the set of values that the function output can take on. This tutorial covers the ideas of domain and range through multiple worked examples. These are really important ideas as you study higher mathematics.

Direct and inverse variation
Whether you are talking about how force relates to acceleration or how the cost of movie tickets relates to the number of people going, it is not uncommon in this universe for things to vary directly. Similarly, when you are, say, talking about how hunger might relate to seeing roadkill, things can vary inversely. This tutorial digs deeper into these ideas with a bunch of examples of direct and inverse variation.

Function inverses
Functions associate a set of inputs with a set of outputs (in fancy language, they &quot;map&quot; one set to another). But can we go the other way around? Are there functions that can start with the outputs as inputs and produce the original inputs as outputs? Yes, there are! They are called function inverses! This tutorial works through a bunch of examples to get you familiar with the world of function inverses.

Well in this tutorial, we will--somewhat arbitrarily--define completely new operators and notation (which are essentially new function definitions without the function notation). Not only will this tutorial expand your mind, it could be the basis of a lot of fun at your next dinner party!

Basic matrix operations
Keanu Reeves&#39; virtual world in the The Matrix (I guess we can call all three movies &quot;The Matrices&quot;) have more in common with this tutorial than you might suspect. Matrices are ways of organizing numbers. They are used extensively in computer graphics, simulations and information processing in general. The super-intelligent artificial intelligences that created The Matrix for Keanu must have used many matrices in the process. This tutorial introduces you to what a matrix is and how we define some basic operations on them.

The process may seem bizarre at first (and maybe even a little longer than that), but there is a certain naturalness to the process. When you study more advanced linear algebra and computer science, it has tons of applications (computer graphics, simulations, etc.)

Inverting matrices
Multiplying by the inverse of a matrix is the closest thing we have to matrix division. Like multiplying a regular number by its reciprocal to get 1, multiplying a matrix by its inverse gives us the identity matrix (1 could be thought of as the &quot;identity scalar&quot;). This tutorial will walk you through this sometimes involved process which will become bizarrely fun once you get the hang of it.

Log-a-what? No, this tutorial is about neither chopped wood nor music (actually logarithms do have applications in music), but it is fascinating nonetheless. You know how to take an exponent. Now you can think about what exponent you have to raise a number to to get another number. Yes, I agree--unstoppable fun for the whole family.

Logarithm basics
If you understand how to take an exponent and you&#39;re looking to take your mathematical game to a new level, then you&#39;ve found the right tutorial. Put simply and confusingly, logarithms are inverse operators to exponents (just as subtraction to addition or division to multiplication). As you&#39;ll see, taking a logarithm of something tells you what exponent you need to raise a base to to get that number.

Multiplying and dividing monomials
&quot;Monomials&quot; sounds like a fancy word, but it just refers to single terms like &quot;4x&quot; or &quot;8xy&quot; or &quot;17x^2z&quot;. In this tutorial, we&#39;ll learn to multiply and divide them using ideas you&#39;re already familiar with (like exponent properties and greatest common factor).

In this tutorial you&#39;ll learn that multiplying things like (4x-7)(-9x+5) just require the distributive property that you learned in elementary school. We&#39;ll touch on the FOIL method because it seems to be covered in a lot of schools, but we don&#39;t like it (we don&#39;t think it is good to memorize processes without knowing the why).

Polynomial basics
&quot;Polynomials&quot; sound like a fancy word, but you just have to break down the root words. &quot;Poly&quot; means &quot;many&quot;. So we&#39;re just talking about &quot;many nomials&quot; and everyone knows what a &quot;nomial&quot; is. Okay, most of us don&#39;t. Well, a polynomials has &quot;many&quot; terms. From understanding what a &quot;term&quot; is to basic simplification, addition and subtraction of polynomials, this tutorial will get you very familiar with the world of many &quot;nomials.&quot; :)

Absolute value
You&#39;ll find absolute value absolutely straightforward--it is just the &quot;distance from zero.&quot; If you have a positive number, it is its own absolute value. If you have a negative number, just make it positive to get the absolute value. As you&#39;ll see as you develop mathematically, this idea will eventually extend to more contexts and dimensions, so it&#39;s super important that you understand this core concept now.

Intro to percentages
At least 50% of the math that you end up doing in your real life will involve percentages. We&#39;re not really sure about that figure, but it sounds authoritative. Anyway, unless you&#39;ve watched this tutorial, you&#39;re really in no position to argue otherwise. As you&#39;ll see &quot;percent&quot; literally means &quot;per cent&quot; or &quot;per hundred&quot;. It&#39;s a pseudo-decimally thing that our society likes to use even though decimals or fractions alone would have done the trick. Either way, we&#39;re 100% sure you&#39;ll find this useful.

If you precisely measure one dimension of a carpet to be 3.256 meters and eyeball the other dimensional to be &quot;roughly 2 meters&quot;, can you really claim that the area is 6.512 square meters (3.256 x 2)? Isn&#39;t that a little misleading? This tutorial gets us thinking about this conundrum and gives us the best practices that scientists and engineers use to not mislead each other.

Moving the decimal to multiply and divide by 10
In our decimal number system, as we move places to the left, the place values increase by a factor of 10 (likewise, they decrease by a factor of 10 as we move rightward). This idea gets direct application when we multiply or divide a decimal number by 10 because it has the effect of shifting every place value one to the right or left (sometime seen as moving the decimal point).

The world of exponents
Addition was nice. Multiplication was cooler. In the mood for a new operation that grows numbers even faster? Ever felt like expressing repeated multiplication with less writing? Ever wanted to describe how most things in the universe grow and shrink? Well, exponents are your answer! This tutorial covers everything from basic exponents to negative and fractional ones. It assumes you remember your multiplication, negative numbers and fractions.

A strong contender for coolest symbol in mathematics is the radical. What is it? How does it relate to exponents? How is the square root different than the cube root? How can I simplify, multiply and add these things? This tutorial assumes you know the basics of exponents and exponent properties and takes you through the radical world for radicals (and gives you some good practice along the way)!

Scientific notation
Scientists and engineers often have to deal with super huge (like 6,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) and super small numbers (like 0.0000000000532) . How can they do this without tiring their hands out? How can they look at a number and understand how large or small it is without counting the digits? The answer is to use scientific notation. If you come to this tutorial with a basic understanding of positive and negative exponents, it should leave you with a new appreciation for representing really huge and really small numbers!

Green&#39;s theorem
It is sometimes easier to take a double integral (a particular double integral as we&#39;ll see) over a region and sometimes easier to take a line integral around the boundary. Green&#39;s theorem draws the connection between the two so we can go back and forth. This tutorial proves Green&#39;s theorem and then gives a few examples of using it. If you can take line integrals through vector fields, you&#39;re ready for Mr. Green.

Intercepts of linear functions
There are many ways to graph a line and this tutorial covers one of the simpler ones. Since you only need two points for a line, let&#39;s find what value an equation takes on when x = 0 (essentially the y-intercept) and what value it takes on when y = 0 (the x-intercept). Then we can graph the line by going through those two points.

Linear equations in one variable
You started first solving equations in sixth and seventh grade. You&#39;ll now extend this skill by tackling fancier equations that have variables on both sides. Common Core Standards: 8.EE.C.7, 8.EE.C.7b
Variables on both sides
Example 1: Variables on both sides
Example 2: Variables on both sides
Equations with variables on both sides
Solving equations with distribution
In this tutorial, we&#39;ll look at slightly more complicated equations that just having variables on both sides. If you can solve these, you&#39;re well on your way to mastering equations! Common Core Standards: 8.EE.C.7, 8.EE.C.7b

Linear equation word problems
In 72 years, Sal will be 3 times as old as he is today (although he might not be... um... capable of doing much). How old is Sal today? The sum of 5 consecutive integers is 15; what are the integers? These classic questions have plagued philosophers through the ages. Actually, they haven&#39;t. But they have plagued algebra students! Even though few people ask questions like this in the real-world, these are strangely enjoyable problems.

Mixed numbers
We can often have fractions whose numerators are not less than the denominators (like 23/4 or 3/2 or even 6/6). These top-heavy friends are called improper fractions. Since they represent a whole or more (in absolute terms), they can also be expressed as a combination of a whole number and a &quot;proper fraction&quot; (one where the numerator is less than the denominator) which is called a &quot;mixed number.&quot; They are both awesome ways of representing a number and getting acquainted with both (as this tutorial does) is super useful in life!

Adding and subtracting negative numbers
You understand that negative numbers represent how far we are &quot;below zero&quot;. Now you are ready to add and subtract them! In this tutorial, we will explain, give examples, and give practice adding and subtracting negative numbers. This is a super-important concept for the rest of your mathematical career so, no pressure, learn it as well as you can! Common Core Standards: 7.NS.A.1, 7.NS.A.1b, 7.NS.A.1c, 7.NS.A.1d

Absolute value
You&#39;ll find absolute value absolutely straightforward--it is just the &quot;distance from zero.&quot; If you have a positive number, it is its own absolute value. If you have a negative number, just make it positive to get the absolute value. As you&#39;ll see as you develop mathematically, this idea will eventually extend to more contexts and dimensions, so it&#39;s super important that you understand this core concept now.

Perpendicular bisectors
In this tutorial, we study lines that are perpendicular to the sides of a triangle and divide them in two (perpendicular bisectors). As we&#39;ll prove, they intersect at a unique point called the cicumcenter (which, quite amazingly, is equidistant to the vertices). We can then create a circle (circumcircle) centered at this point that goes through all the vertices. This tutorial is the extension of the core narrative of the Geometry &quot;course&quot;. After this, you might want to look at the tutorial on angle bisectors.

Angle bisectors
This tutorial experiments with lines that divide the angles of a triangle in two (angle bisectors). As we&#39;ll prove, all three angle bisectors actually intersect at one point called the incenter (amazing!). We&#39;ll also prove that this incenter is equidistant from the sides of the triangle (even more amazing!). This allows us to create a circle centered at the incenter that is tangent to the sides of the triangle (not surprisingly called the &quot;incircle&quot;).

Medians and centroids
You&#39;ve explored perpendicular bisectors and angle bisectors, but you&#39;re craving to study lines that intersect the vertices of a a triangle AND bisect the opposite sides. Well, you&#39;re luck because that (medians) is what we are going to study in this tutorial. We&#39;ll prove here that the medians intersect at a unique point (amazing!) called the centroid and divide the triangle into six mini triangles of equal area (even more amazing!). The centroid also always happens to divide all the medians in segments with lengths at a 1:2 ration (stupendous!).

Altitudes
Ok. You knew triangles where cool, but you never imagined they were this cool! Well, this tutorial will take things even further. After perpendicular bisectors, angle bisector and medians, the only other thing (that I can think of) is a line that intersects a vertex and the opposite side (called an altitude). As we&#39;ll see, these are just as cool as the rest and, as you may have guessed, intersect at a unique point called the orthocenter (unbelievable!).
Proof: Triangle altitudes are concurrent (orthocenter)
Common orthocenter and centroid
Bringing it all together
This tutorial brings together all of the major ideas in this topic. First, it starts off with a light-weight review of the various ideas in the topic. It then goes into a heavy-weight proof of a truly, truly, truly amazing idea. It was amazing enough that orthocenters, circumcenters, and centroids exist , but we&#39;ll see in the videos on Euler lines that they sit on the same line themselves (incenters must be feeling lonely)!!!!!!!

Basic probability
Can I pick a red frog out of a bag that only contains marbles? Is it smart to buy a lottery ticket? Even if we are unsure about whether something will happen, can we start to be mathematical about the &quot;chances&quot; of an event (essentially realizing that some things are more likely than others). This tutorial will introduce us to the tools that allow us to think about random events.

Venn diagrams and adding probabilities
What is the probability of getting a diamond or an ace from a deck of cards? Well I could get a diamond that is not an ace, an ace that is not a diamond, or the ace of diamonds. This tutorial helps us think these types of situations through a bit better (especially with the help of our good friend, the Venn diagram).

Compound, independent events
What is the probability of making three free throws in a row (LeBron literally asks this in this tutorial). In this tutorial, we&#39;ll explore compound events happening where the probability of one event is not dependent on the outcome of another (compound, independent, events).
Compound probability of independent events
Getting at least one head
Example: Probability of rolling doubles
LeBron asks: What are the chances of making 10 free throws in a row?
LeBron asks: What are the chances of three free throws versus one three pointer?
Frequency probability and unfair coins
Example: Getting two questions right on an exam
Example: Rolling even three times
Independent probability
Frequency stability
Compound events
Dependent probability
What&#39;s the probability of picking two &quot;e&quot; from the bag in scrabble (assuming that I don&#39;t replace the tiles). Well, the probability of picking an &#39;e&#39; on your second try depends on what happened in the first (if you picked an &#39;e&#39; the first time around, then there is one less &#39;e&#39; in the bag). This is just one of many, many type of scenarios involving dependent probability.

Limit basics
Limits are the core tool that we build upon for calculus. Many times, a function can be undefined at a point, but we can thinking about what the function &quot;approaches&quot; as it gets closer and closer to that point (this is the &quot;limit&quot;). Other times, the function may be defined at a point, but it may approach a different limit. There are many, many times where the function value is the same as the limit at a point. Either way, this is a powerful tool as we start thinking about slope of a tangent line to a curve. If you have a decent background in algebra (graphing and functions in particular), you&#39;ll hopefully enjoy this tutorial!

Induction
Proof by induction is a core tool. This tutorial walks you through the general idea that if 1) something is true for a base case (say when n=1) and 2) if it is true for n, then it is also true for n+1, then it must be true for all n! Amazing!

Basic sequences and series
This sequence (pun intended) of videos and exercises will help us explore ordered lists of objects--even infinite ones--that often have some pattern to them. We will then explore constructing sequences where the nth term is the sum of the first n terms of another sequence (series). This is surprisingly useful in a whole series (pun intended) of applications from finance to drug dosage.

Solving systems of equations for the king
Whether in the real world or a cliche fantasy one, systems of equations are key to solving super-important issues like &quot;the make-up of change in a troll&#39;s pocket&quot; or &quot;how can order the right amount of potato chips for a King&#39;s party.&quot; Join us as we cover (and practice with examples and exercises) all of the major ways of solving a system: graphically, elimination, and substitution.

	<field name="course_intro">The history of modern art is not simply a linear progression of styles.

Life and death of stars
Stars begin when material drifting in space condenses due to gravity to be dense enough for fusion to occur. Depending on the volume and make-up of this material, the star could then develop into very different things--from supernovae, to neutron stars, to black holes. This tutorial explores the life of stars and will have you appreciating the grand weirdness of our reality.

Quasars and galactive collisions
Quasars are the brightest objects in the universe. The gamma rays from them could sterilize a solar system (i.e. obliterate life). What do we think these objects are? Why don&#39;t we see any close by (which we should be thankful for)? Could they tell us what our own galaxy may have been like 1 billion or so years ago?

Stellar parallax
We&#39;ve talked a lot about distances to stars, but how do we know? Stellar parallax--which looks at how much a star shifts in the sky when Earth is at various points in its orbit--is the oldest technique we have for measuring how far stars are. It is great for &quot;nearby&quot; stars even with precise instruments (i.e, in our part of our galaxy). To measure distance further, we have to start thinking about Cepheid variables (other tutorial).

Stellar parallax clarification
Parsec definition
Cepheid variables
Stellar parallax can be used for &quot;nearby&quot; stars, but what if we want to measure further out? Well this tutorial will expose you to a class of stars that helps us do this. Cepheids are large, bright, variable stars that are visible in other galaxies. We know how bright they should be and can gauge how far they are by how bright they look to us.

Scale of the small and large
We humans have trouble comprehending something larger than, say, our planet (and even that isn&#39;t easy to conceptualize) and smaller than, say, a cell (once again, still not easy to think about). This tutorial explores the scales of the universe well beyond that of normal human comprehension, but does so in a way that makes them at least a little more understandable. How does a bacteria compare to an atom? What about a galaxy to a star? Turn on your inertial dampeners. You&#39;re in store for quite a ride!

Light and fundamental forces
This tutorial gives an overview of light and the fundamental four forces. You won&#39;t have a degree in physics after this, but it&#39;ll give you some good context for understanding cosmology and the universe we are experiencing. It should be pretty understandable by someone with a very basic background in science.
Introduction to light
Four fundamental forces
Scale of earth, sun, galaxy and universe
The Earth is huge, but it is tiny compared to the Sun (which is super huge). But the Sun is tiny compared to the solar system which is tiny compared to the distance to the next star. Oh, did we mention that there are over 100 billion stars in our galaxy (which is about 100,000 light years in diameter) which is one of hundreds of billions of galaxies in just the observable universe (which might be infinite for all we know). Don&#39;t feel small. We find it liberating. Your everyday human stresses are nothing compared to this enormity that we are a part of. Enjoy the fact that we get to be part of this vastness!
Scale of earth and sun
Scale of Solar System
Scale of distance to closest stars
Scale of the galaxy
Intergalactic scale

Time scale of the cosmos
Not only is the universe unimaginable large (possibly infinite), but it is also unimaginably old. If you were feeling small in space, wait until you realize that all of human history is but a tiny blip in the history of the universe.
Cosmological time scale 1
Cosmological time scale 2
Big bang and expansion of the universe
What does it mean for the universe to expand? Was the &quot;big bang&quot; an explosion of some sort or a rapid expansion of space-time (it was the latter)? If the universe was/is expanding, what is &quot;outside&quot; it? How do we know how far/old things are? This tutorial addresses some of the oldest questions known to man.

Do lungs also contain systemic arteries/veins, or just pulmonary ones?
 • 23 Votes   • 1 Comment • Flag 2 years ago by   Yuri Sakhno
The answer to this can be found in the video &quot;Two Circulations in the Body&quot; at 9:30. The lungs receive oxygenated blood from the Bronchial Arteries which are a part of the systemic circulation. Some of the blood drains back through the Bronchial Veins, but some of it joins the deoxygenated blood in the lungs from the Pulmonary Arteries, becomes re-oxygenated, and re-enters the heart through the Pulmonary Veins.

I know the colors in these videos are primarily so it&#39;s super easy to understand and remember. But real veins and venous/deoxygenated blood aren&#39;t really blue, are they?
 • 12 Votes   • Comment • Flag 2 years ago by   John
General x-rays usually only show contrast (black and white) and are more suited for denser materials like bone, unless you use a few tricks like contrast mediums and sophisticated processing algorithms. 

However, if you look at blood coming out of a ECMO, there is a definite difference in color compared to the un-oxygenated blood going in. Indeed, the un-oxygenated blood has a darker &#39;bluish&#39; hue to it as the hemoglobin hasn&#39;t yet been saturated with oxygen.

@9:30 There are valves that close in the veins? Do they close do to the blood actually trying to flow backwards through the system or is it due to the pressure fluctuates as the heart pumps?
4 Votes   • Comment • Flag 2 years ago by   ∫∫ Greg Boyle dG dB
I found this: &quot;Venous valves will close when the reversal of the normal pressure gradient generates a sufficient reverse flow velocity...Valve closure is an abrupt cessation of reverse flow.&quot; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2184798

He colored the arteries blue to show the vessels that would be carrying deoxygenated blood. After blood has gone through systemic circulation it comes back to the heart as deoxygenated blood through veins. Once that blood is brought to the system it is transported to the lungs from the heart through arteries still deoxygenated. This blood is then oxygenated and returned to the heart through veins for systemic or coronary circulation. Remember veins carry blood to the heart arteries go away. The… (more)

Capillaries are the smallest blood vessels - some are smaller than the red cells that pass through them. They&#39;re the part of the circulatory system where your cells can actually get to the oxygen and nutrients in the blood.

Introduction to economics
This very short tutorial gives us the big picture of what economics is all about and, in particular, compares macroeconomics (where you are now) to microeconomics.
Introduction to economics
GDP and the circular flow of income and expenditures
Economics can some times get confusing because one person&#39;s expenditure is another person&#39;s income which can then be used for expenditure and on and on and on. Seems very circular. It is. This tutorial helps us grapple with this and introduces us to the primary tool economists use to measure a nations productivity/income/expenditure--GDP (gross domestic product).
Circular flow of income and expenditures
Parsing gross domestic product
More on final and intermediate GDP contributions
Components of GDP
You already understand the circular nature of the economy and how GDP is defined from the last tutorial. Now let&#39;s think about how economists define the composition of GDP. In particular, we&#39;ll focus on consumption (C), investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports.
Investment and consumption
Income and expenditure views of GDP
Components of GDP
Examples of accounting for GDP
Real and nominal GDP
The value of a currency is constantly changing (usually going down in terms of what you can buy). Given this, how can we compare GDP measured in dollars in one year to another year? This tutorial answers that question by introducing you to real GDP and GDP deflators.

Measuring cost of living --inflation and the consumer price index
We might generally sense that our cost of living is going up (inflation), but how can we measure it? This tutorial shows how it is done in the United States with the consumer price index (CPI).
Introduction to inflation
Actual CPI-U basket of goods
Inflation data
Real and nominal return
We think we&#39;re getting a certain return on our investments, but can we put it in terms of real purchasing power since the value of money is constantly changing? The answer is yes and this tutorial shows you how.
Real and nominal return
Calculating real return in last year dollars
Relation between nominal and real returns and inflation
Deflation
Prices don&#39;t always go up. Sometimes they go down (we call this deflation). This tutorial explains how this happens.
Deflation
Velocity of money rather than quantity driving prices
Deflation despite increases in money supply
Inflationary and deflationary scenarios
This tutorial walks through various scenarios of moderate and extreme price changes. Very good way to understand how activity in the economy may impact price (and vice versa).
Moderate inflation in a good economy
Stagflation
Deflationary spiral
Hyperinflation
The Phillips curve: Inflation and unemployment
Economists have notices a correlation between unemployment and correlation (you may wan to guess what type of correlation). On some level, this tutorial is common sense, but it will give you fancy labels for this relation so that you can sound fancy at fancy parties.

Put and call options
Options allow investors and speculators to hedge downside (or upside). It allows them to trade on a belief that prices will change a lot--just not clear about direction. It allows them to benefit in any market (with leverage) if they speculate correctly. This tutorial walks through option basics and even goes into some fairly sophisticated option mechanics.

Black-Scholes formula
Options have been bought and sold for ages, but finding a rational way to price them seemed beyond our mathematical know-how... until 1973 when Fischer Black and Myron Scholes showed up and gave us the Black-Scholes model. This work was later extended by Robert Merton and now underpins much of modern finance.

In the fall of 2008, it became clear that a cascade of bank failures was happening because of shoddy loans and exotic securities (both which fueled a now popping housing bubble). In an attempt to avoid a depression, the Treasury Secretary (Hank Paulson) wanted to pour $1 Trillion into the same banks that had created the mess. This tutorial walks us through the beginnings of the mess and possible solutions. Historical note: it was created as the crisis was unfolding.

Compound interest basics
Interest is the basis of modern capital markets. Depending on whether you are lending or borrowing, it can be viewed as a return on an asset (lending) or the cost of capital (borrowing). This tutorial gives an introduction to this fundamental concept, including what it means to compound. It also gives a rule of thumb that might make it easy to do some rough interest calculations in your head.

Credit cards and loans
Most of us have borrowed to buy something. Credit cards, in particular, can be quite convenient (but dangerous if not used in moderation). This tutorial explains credit card interest, how credit card companies make money and a far more silly way of borrowing money called &quot;payday&quot; loans.

Personal bankruptcy
Back in the day (like medieval Europe), you would actually be thrown in jail if you couldn&#39;t pay your debts (debtor&#39;s prison). That seemed like a pretty awful thing to do (not to mention that lenders are much less likely to be paid by someone rotting in prison), so governments created an &quot;out&quot; called bankruptcy (which, as you&#39;ll see, is a pseudo-painful &quot;reset&quot; button on your finances).

Banking and money
We all use money and most of us use banks. Despite this, the actual working of the banking system is a bit of a mystery to most (especially fractional reserve banking). This older tutorial (bad handwriting and resolution) starts from a basic society looking to do more than barter and incrementally builds to a modern society with fraction reserve banking. Through this process, you will hopefully gain a deep understanding of how money and banking works in our modern world.

Aggregate demand and aggregate supply
This tutorial looks at supply and demand in aggregate-from the perspective of the entire economy (not just the market for one good or service). Instead of thinking of quantity of one good, we think of total output (GDP). Very useful model for thinking through macroeconomic events.
Aggregate demand
Shifts in aggregate demand
Long-run aggregate supply
Short run aggregate supply
Historical circumstances explained by AD/AS
In the last tutorial, we claimed that the aggregate demand and aggregate supply model (AD-AS) would be useful for analyzing macroeconomic events. Well, in this tutorial, we&#39;ll do exactly that.

The business cycle
Economies never have a long steady march upwards. They constantly oscillate between growth and recession. This tutorial gives a little intuition for why that is.
The business cycle
Monetary and fiscal policy
Governments (and pseudo government entities like central banks) have two tools at their disposal to try to impact the business cycle --monetary and fiscal policy. This will help you understand what they are.

Keynesian thinking
Whether you love him or hate him (or just consider him a friend that you respect but disagree with every-now-and-then), Keynes has helped define how many modern governments think about their economies. This tutorial explains how his thinking was a fundamental departure from classical economics.

Balance of payments- current account and capital account
In this tutorial we will see how trade and assets (including money) changing hands are fundamentally intertwined. Not only that, but we will see how this can be accounted for through the capital account (assets changing hands) and current account (trade).

Why current and capital accounts net out
Currency reserves
This tutorial delves into how and why countries (usually their central banks) would want to keep other countries&#39; currency in reserve. It then goes into why this sometime leaves the reserve-holding country open to a speculative attack (this is seriously high drama).

Average costs (ATC, MC) and marginal revenue (MR)
In this tutorial, Sal uses the example of an orange juice business to help us understand the ideas of average total cost (ATC), marginal cost (MC) and marginal revenue (MR). We then use this understanding to answer the age-old question, &quot;how much orange juice should I produce?&quot; Finally, we use these ideas to construct a long-run supply curve.

Nash equilibrium
If you haven&#39;t watched the movie &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;, you should. It is about John Nash (played by Russell Crowe) who won the Nobel Prize in economics for his foundational contributions to game theory. This is what this tutorial is about. Nash put some structure around how players in a &quot;game&quot; can optimize their outcomes (if the movie is to be fully believed, this insight struck him when he realize that if all his friends hit on the most pretty girl, he should hit on the second-most pretty one). In this tutorial, we use the classic &quot;prisoner&#39;s dilemma&quot; to highlight this concept.

Why parties in a cartel will cheat
You know what Nash equilibrium is (from the other tutorial). Now we apply it to a scenario that is fairly realistic--parties to a cartel cheating. A cartel is a group of actors that agree (sometimes illegally) to coordinate their production/pricing to maximize their collective economic profit. What we will see, however, is that this is not a &quot;Pareto optimal&quot; state and they will soon start producing more than agreed on.

Perfect competition
This tutorial looks at markets that are deemed to have &quot;perfect competition.&quot; This means that there are many players with identical products, no barriers to entry, no advantage for existing players and good pricing information. Few to no real market completely matches this theoretical ideal, but many are close. Even the example we use in this tutorial (the airline industry) isn&#39;t quite perfect (you should think about why).
Perfect competition
Monopoly
No, we aren&#39;t talking about the board game although the game does try to approximate what this tutorial is about--notice that you can charge more rent at either Boardwalk or Park Place if you own both (you have a &quot;monopoly&quot; in the navy blue market). The opposite of perfect competition is when you have only one firm operating. This tutorial explores what this firm would do to maximize economic profit.

Siena
When we think of the Renaissance, we tend to think of Florence (and Rome). But the city of Siena also deserves our attention. Today, the lovely walled city of Siena is one of the best preserved Medieval cities in Europe and it was chosen by the United Nations as a World Heritage Site. In the 14th Century, Siena was an independent nation and often at war with its neighbor, Florence. Some of the most important art of the 14th Century was commissioned for Siena’s Cathedral and town hall. Duccio and his students, the Lorenzetti Brothers and Simone Martini produced large-scale painting with an intricacy and subtle coloration that is unique in the Renaissance.

When Vasari wrote his enormously influential book, Lives of the Artists, in the 16th century, he credited Giotto, the 14th century Florentine artist with beginning &quot;the great art of painting as we know it today, introducing the technique of drawing accurately from life, which had been neglected for more than two hundred years.&quot; In other words, for Vasari, Giotto was the first artist to leave behind the medieval practice of painting what one knows and believes, for the practice of painting what one sees. This tutorial looks at painting and sculpture in both Pisa and Florence to highlight some of the most forward-thinking art of this century.

Pre-Raphaelites
In 1848, a small group of young artists banded together and formed “The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood,” a name which sounds intentionally backward-looking and medieval. The Pre-Raphaelites looked back to art before the time of Raphael (before about 1500 that is)—before the art of the Renaissance was reduced to formulas followed for centuries by artists associated with the art academies of Europe. Their idea was that the art before Raphael was more sincere, more true to nature and how we see, and therefore less formulaic. These artists also embraced a wide range of subjects, including modern life, biblical and literary subjects, and even history. By looking backwards, the Pre-Raphaelites led British art into the modern era.

Late Victorian
British art saw a return to the classical after the 1860s, not just in terms of style, but also subject matter. Alma Tadema created sensual Victorian visions of the ancient Greeks and Romans, and Leighton too rendered classicizing figures and subjects. Both of these artists, together with Sargent, were influenced by the Aesthetic Movement, where the subject or narrative of a work of art was minimized in favor of a focus on issues of form (color harmonies, line, composition).

Realism
In the mid-Nineteenth Century, great art was still defined as art that took it’s subjects from religion, history or mythology and its style from ancient Greece and Rome. Hardly what we would consider modern and appropriate for an industrial, commercial, urban culture! Courbet agreed, and so did his friend, the writer Charles Baudelaire who called for an art that would depict, as he called it, the beauty of modern life. Courbet painted the reality of life in the countryside—not the idealized peasants that were the usual fare at the exhibits in Paris. The revolution of 1848, in which both the working class and the middle class played a significant role, set the stage for Realism. Later, Manet and then Degas painted modern life in Paris, a city which was undergoing rapid modernization in the period after 1855 (the Second Empire).

Art and the French state
Despite the brief dismantling of the Royal Academy during the French Revolution, art remained an extension of the power of the French State which regularly purchased art that it favored (often art that supported its political objectives). Through the Royal Academy (originally been founded by Louis XIV), the state extended its reach to the official exhibitions (salons) and to matters of style and subject matter through the École des Beaux Arts (School of Fine Arts). These were not just the official institutions of art, they were, in essence, the only institutions available for living artists to train and to make their work known. This tutorial looks at a crucial moment for painting, on the eve of the Revolution of 1848. We also examine one of the great State commissions of the Second Empire, The Opera House, as well as The Dance, a sculpture that adorned its façade.

Impressionism
Impressionism is both a style, and the name of a group of artists who did something radical—in 1874 they banded together and held their own independent exhibition. These artists described, in fleeting sensations of light, the new leisure pastimes of the city and its suburbs It’s hard to imagine, but at this time in France, the only place of consequence that artists could exhibit their work was the official government-sanctioned exhibitions (called salons), held just once a year, and controlled by a conservative jury. The Impressionists painted modern Paris and landscapes with a loose open brushstrokes, bright colors, and unconventional compositions—none of which was appreciated by the salon jury!

Post-Impressionism
The work of van Gogh, Gauguin, Cézanne and Seurat together constitute Post-Impressionism and yet their work is so varied and unrelated, we might never otherwise think of these four artists as a group. Certainly van Gogh and Gauguin were friends and they briefly painted together, but each of these artists was concerned with solving particular issues that had to do with their own individual sensibility. Ironically, if anything ties these artists together it is this focus on subjectivity. This tutorial explores the sketchy multiperspectival views of Cézanne, Seurat’s systematized critiques of upper middle-class Paris, Gauguin’s fascination with the primitive and exotic, and van Gogh’s unerring ability to convey deeply human experiences.

Post-Impressionism
Symbolism &amp; Art Nouveau
The 1880s saw a shift away from the modern-life focus of Impressionism, as artists turned toward the interior self, to dreams, and myth. There was a sense that Impressionism had been too tied up with the materialism of middle-class culture. In some ways, van Gogh and Gauguin can also be seen as Symbolists. Many Symbolist belonged to groups of artists who broke away (or seceded) from the art establishment in their respective countries, to hold their own exhibitions. For example, Klimt belonged to the Vienna Secession (he was its first president), Khnopff to a similar group in Belgium called Lex XX (The Twenty), and Stuck co-founded the Munich Secession.

The Art of Our Time
The postwar figure
Artists first represented the human body more than 30,000 years ago and haven’t stopped since. Figurative art has been a continuous tradition through human history. Even in societies where the biblical law forbidding the graven image is most strictly interpreted (Judaism and Islam for example), there have always been instances of figural art. The same is true for the era of modernist abstraction when artists found new ways to portray the body on canvas or with the lens of a camera that could profoundly describe the human condition in , and abstraction the post-holocaust era.

Pop &amp; After
When people walk into an art museum they often expect to see treasures of their cultural history—beautifully crafted precious objects that express profound truths—images of God, nature, man’s heroism, but Campbell soup cans hawked on TV? Pop art sought to upend our comfortable understanding of what art is and it did just that. Warhol, Lichtenstein, Oldenburg, and others confronted the visual reality of our commercial consumer culture by focusing on the mechanics of representation and the subject matter of daily life in the middle of the 20th Century.

Minimalism and the land
“Primary Structures,” “ABC Art,” and “Minimalism” are terms that attempted to categorize the work of Donald Judd, Dan Flavin, Sol Lewitt and other artists who produced hard edged, often geometric and seemingly machined objects in the later 1960s and early 1970s. These stark, often cold and cerebral forms were the very antithesis of the deeply emotive gestural art of the Abstract Expressionists and their followers who had dominated the New York art scene since the 1940s. Here was an art that renounced the authentic “hand’ of the artist and sought instead to create forms without reference to the world beyond the object’s own logic except perhaps as Platonic expressions of a pure ideal.

Minimalism and the land
Process art
By the second half of the 20th Century, the avant-garde had an avant-garde of its own. Even as Pop, Minimal and Concept artists renounced the handmade work of art, a small group of women recognized the subversive value of handicraft in an age of industrial manufacturing and in an art world dominated by male artists and critics who sought theoretical purity. During her short career, Eva Hesse resituated the ancient question of how to meaningfully represent the human body and unleashed decades of experimentation that continues to this day. Judy Chicago, Linda Benglis, Jackie Windsor, Faith Ringgold, and others used the lowly status of craft and its historical association with female artisans to contrast with “high art.” By focusing of the act of making, on process and craft, these women began the process of fracturing Modernism’s reductive and largely male narratives.

Conceptual art
Can art be an enactment? Can the “art” be relocated from the object crafted by an artist to the more ephemeral reaction of the viewer? Must an artist actually “make” a work of art at all? Conceptual artists recognized that when the 19th Century avant-garde broke with the academies and their emphasis on technical execution (the blending color or compositional clarity for example), they were freer to focus on more conceptual issues such as modern urban life, subjectivity, or pictorial language. Fast forward to the second half of the Twentieth Century when intellectual content became the defining characteristic of art and concept fully eclipsed craft. In the 1960 and 70s the art of Beuys, Haacke and others became increasingly conceptual. These artists used found objects, performance, and installation while de-emphasizing the act of “object making.”

Postmodernism
If you’ve done the tutorials on Nineteenth and Twentieth Century art then you likely have an idea that by “Modernism,” art historians are referring to a set of ideas that characterize art and culture after about 1848. Key to understanding Modern art are the ideas of a heroic “avant-garde” that challenges authority and the expression of the individual (one that is invariably white and male). The term “Post-Modernism,” was initially used in the art world in 1979 for architecture that arbitrarily borrowed historical styles with little regard for original meaning or context. The term was quickly and broadly adopted, and came to refer to a strategy to undermine Modernism’s utopian and heroizing tendencies by using multiple yet simultaneous critical perspectives. Post-Modernism was not anti-Modernism, it was instead, an effort to destabilize Modernist narratives with deeply skeptical critical strategies that emphasized the plurality of gender, race, nationality, politics, and economic inequality.

Early Christian
The first Christians were often persecuted in the Ancient Roman empire, but when—thanks to Constantine—Christianity became legal in the 4th century, Christians could worship openly and the first churches were built in Rome and Christians could be buried in tombs sculpted with Christian imagery. This tutorial takes you on a tour of early Christian churches, and takes a close look at the sarcophagus of a Roman senator who died in 359.

Early Medieval
Christian art, which was initially influenced by the illusionary quality of classical art, started to move away from naturalistic representation and instead pushed toward abstraction. Artists began to abandon classical artistic conventions like shading, modeling and perspective—conventions that make the image appear more real. They no longer observed details in nature to record them in paint, bronze, marble, or mosaic.

Byzantine
Today, we know the city of Constantinople as Istanbul (in fact there’s a song about that!). But even before it was Constantinople, it was the ancient city of Byzantium, and it was renamed Constantinople (city of Constantine) by none other than the Emperor Constantine himself (it’s good to be the emperor!). From there a succession of emperors ruled the Byzantine empire as the Roman empire dissolved. For two centuries, the Byzantine empire even included the Italian city of Ravenna, where many churches decorated with astoundingly beautiful mosaics can still be found. In Byzantine art we see a departure from the naturalism of the ancient Greek and Roman world. Figures float in ethereal gold heavenly spaces in mosaics, and we find intricate carvings made from ivory, a luxurious material imported from Africa.

Arts of the Islamic world
More than 1 billion people call themselves muslim and this monotheistic religion is now estimated to be the second largest in the world. Islamic culture was among the most advanced and tolerant during the Medieval era. Cities from Isfahan in the East to Grenada in the West became important centers of art and learning. This tutorial looks at the sculpture, tilework, costume and interior spaces of this brilliant culture.

Romanesque
Visogoths, Ostrogoths, and Vikings, oh my! Western Europe was not a peaceful place during the 600 years after the fall of the Roman Empire. Western Europe (what is now Italy, France, Spain, England, etc.) had been repeatedly invaded. The result was a fractured feudal society with little stability and little economic growth. Charlemagne and the Ottonians had partially and briefly unified the West, and of course the Church was a stabilizing institution, but it was only in the 11th Century that everything changed. Now there was finally enough peace and prosperity to allow for travel and for the widespread construction of large buildings. These were, with rare exceptions, the first large structures to be built in the West since the fall of the Romans so many centuries before. We call the period Romanesque (Roman-like) because the masons of this period looked back to the architecture of ancient Rome. The relative calm of the Romanesque period also meant it was possible to travel, and the faithful set out on pilgrimages in great numbers to visit holy relics in churches across Europe. This meant that ideas and styles also traveled, towns grew and churches were built and enlarged.

Prehistoric
You’ve seen the drawing of human evolution showing a procession of monkey, ape, primitive and modern man? Well, somewhere along that line early man could be shown holding a paint brush and a chisel. Mankind has been making art for at least 100,000 years. Why was the earliest art made? What might it have once meant? This tutorial focuses on what we do and do not know about one of the earliest representations of the human body, The Venus of Willendorf.

Ancient cultures established the first cities and large scale architecture.

Woody Allen famously said, “I don&#39;t want to achieve immortality through my work. I want to achieve it through not dying.” The ancient Egyptians on the other hand, confronted death head-on. In fact, the art of the ancient Egyptians was (for the most part) never meant to be seen by the eyes of the living—it was meant to benefit the dead in the afterlife. Throughout human history, art has been recognized for its ability to outlive us and has been used as a receptacle for our fears and hopes about our own mortality.

Before the small village of Rome became “Rome” with a capital R (to paraphrase D.H. Lawrence), a brilliant civilization once controlled almost the entire peninsula we now call Italy. This was the Etruscan civilization, a vanished culture whose achievements set the stage not only for the development of ancient Roman art and culture but for the Italian Renaissance as well.

The basics
If you’ve ever found yourself saying “How can that be art?,” then this tutorial is for you! We’ve tried to answer the real questions that come up during a typical visit to a modern art museum. Learn how describing can help you slow down and better understand what a work of art is communicating. Learn how important historical context is and how meaning can change over time. This tutorial asks: Why is art important? How can a snow shovel be art? How can we find meaning in abstract art?

In 1517 a German theologian and monk, Martin Luther, challenged the authority of the Pope and sparked the Protestant Reformation. His ideas spread quickly, thanks in part to the printing press. By challenging the power of the Church, and asserting the authority of individual conscience (it was increasingly possible for people to read the bible in the language that they spoke), the Reformation laid the foundation for the value that modern culture places on the individual.

Overview and history of algebra
Did you realize that the word &quot;algebra&quot; comes from Arabic (just like &quot;algorithm&quot; and &quot;al jazeera&quot; and &quot;Aladdin&quot;)? And what is so great about algebra anyway? This tutorial doesn&#39;t explore algebra so much as it introduces the history and ideas that underpin it.

Why all the letters in algebra?
Variables and expressions
Wait, why are we using letters in math? How can an &#39;x&#39; represent a number? What number is it? I must figure this out!!! Yes, you must. This tutorial is great if you&#39;re just beginning to delve into the world of algebraic variables and expressions.

The why of algebra
Much of algebra seems obsessed with &quot;doing the same thing to both sides&quot;. Why is this? How can we develop an intuition for which algebraic operations are valid and which ones aren&#39;t? This tutorial takes a high-level, conceptual walk-through of what an equation represents and why we do the same thing to both sides of it.
Why we do the same thing to both sides: Simple equations
Representing a relationship with a simple equation
One-step equation intuition

x-intercepts and y-intercepts of linear functions
There are many ways to graph a line and this tutorial covers one of the simpler ones. Since you only need two points for a line, let&#39;s find what value an equation takes on when x = 0 (essentially the y-intercept) and what value it takes on when y = 0 (the x-intercept). Then we can graph the line by going through those two points.

If you&#39;ve ever struggled to tell someone just how steep something is, you&#39;ll find the answer here. In this tutorial, we cover the idea of the slope of a line. We also think about how slope relates to the equation of a line and how you can determine the slope or y-intercept given some clues. This tutorial is appropriate for someone who understands the basics of graphing equations and want to dig a bit deeper. After this tutorial, you will be prepared to start thinking deeper about the equation of a line.

Solving quadratics by taking square root
Let&#39;s explore one of the most fundamental ways to solve a quadratic equation when it is already written in terms of a square of an expression in x--solve for the expression and take the square root. As we&#39;ll see, equations are not always in this form, and that is where completing the square--which puts equations in this form--is essential!

The quadratic formula (quadratic equation)
Probably one of the most famous tools in mathematics, the quadratic formula (a.k.a. quadratic equation) helps you think about the roots of ANY quadratic (even ones that have no real roots)! As you&#39;ll see, it is just the by-product of completing the square, but understanding and applying the formula will take your algebra skills to new heights. In theory, one could apply the quadratic formula in a brainless way without understanding factoring or completing the square, but that&#39;s lame and uninteresting. We recommend coming to this tutorial with a solid background in both of those techniques. Have fun!

Simplifying rational expressions
You get a rational expression when you divide one polynomial by another. If you have a good understanding of factoring quadratics, you&#39;ll be able to apply this skill here to help realize where a rational expression may not be defined and how we can go about simplifying it.

Adding and subtracting rational expressions
Well, rational expressions are just algebraic expressions formed by dividing one expression by another. In this tutorial, we&#39;ll see that, even though they may look hairy, adding and subtracting rational expressions involves most of what we know about adding and subtracting numeric fractions.

Graphing rational functions
Rational functions are often not defined at certain points and have very interesting behavior has the input variable becomes very large in magnitude. This tutorial explores how to graph these functions, paying attention to these special features. We&#39;ll talk a lot about vertical and horizontal asymptotes.

Partial fraction expansion
If you add several rational expressions with lower degree denominator, you are likely to get a sum with a higher degree denominator (which is the least-common multiple of the lower-degree ones). This tutorial lets us think about going the other way--start with a rational expression with a higher degree denominator and break it up as the sum of simpler rational expressions.

The why of algebra
Algebra seems mysterious to me. I really don&#39;t &quot;get&quot; what an equation represents. Why do we do the same thing to both sides? This tutorial is a conceptual journey through the basics of algebra. It is made for someone just beginning their algebra adventure. But even folks who feel pretty good that they know how to manipulate equations might pick up a new intuition or two.

Like the &quot;Why of algebra&quot; and &quot;Super Yoga plans&quot; tutorials, we&#39;ll introduce you to the most fundamental ideas of what equations mean and how to solve them. We&#39;ll then do a bunch of examples to make sure you&#39;re comfortable with things like 3x – 7 = 8. So relax, grab a cup of hot chocolate, and be on your way to becoming an algebra rockstar. And, by the way, in any of the &quot;example&quot; videos, try to solve the problem on your own before seeing how Sal does it. It makes the learning better!

You feel comfortable solving for an unknown. But life is all about stepping outside of your comfort zone--it&#39;s the only way you can grow! This tutorial takes solving equations to another level by making things a little more abstract. You will now solve for a variable, but it will be in terms of other variables. Don&#39;t worry, we think you&#39;ll find it quite therapeutic once you get the hang of it.

Evaluating expressions with unknown variables
When solving equations, there is a natural hunger to figure out what an unknown is equal to. This is especially the case if we want to evaluate an expression that the unknown is part of. This tutorial exposes us to a class of solvable problems that challenges this hunger and forces us to be the thinking human beings that we are! In case you&#39;re curious, these types of problems are known to show up on standardized exams to see if you are really a thinking human (as opposed to a robot possum).

Intro to addition and subtraction
Adding and subtracting is the basis of all mathematics. This tutorial introduces you to one-digit addition and subtraction. You might become pretty familiar with the number line too!
Basic addition

Subtraction within 5
Two digit addition and subtraction
In this tutorial, we&#39;ll start adding and subtracting numbers that have two (yes, two!) digits. We won&#39;t be doing any carrying or borrowing (you&#39;ll learn what those are shortly) so you can see that adding or subtracting two digit numbers is really just an extension of what you already know.
Example: Adding two digit numbers (no carrying)
Addition within 20

Level 2 addition
Addition with carrying
You&#39;re somewhat familar with adding, say, 17+12 or 21+32, but what happens for 13+19? Essentially, what happens when I max out the &quot;ones place&quot;. In this tutorial, we&#39;ll introduce you to the powerful tool of carrying and why it works.
Carrying when adding three digit numbers
Why carrying works
Examples of regrouping when adding three digit numbers
Addition within 100
Addition 4

Subtraction with borrowing (regrouping)
You can subtract 21 from 45, but are a bit perplexed trying to subtract 26 from 45 (how do you subtract the 6 in 26 from the 5 in 45). This tutorial is your answer. You&#39;ll see that we can essentially &quot;regroup&quot; the value in a number from one place to another to solve your problem. This is also often called borrowing (although it is like &quot;borrowing&quot; sugar from your neighbor in that you never give it back).

You know what prime numbers are and how to identify them. In this tutorial, we&#39;ll see that *all* positive whole numbers can be broken down into products of prime numbers (In some way, prime numbers are the &quot;atoms&quot; of the number world that can be multiplied to create any other number). Besides being a fascinating idea, it is also extremely useful. Prime factorization can be used to decrypt encrypted information!

Understanding fractions
If you don&#39;t understand fractions, you won&#39;t be even 1/3 educated. Glasses will seem half empty rather than half full. You&#39;ll be lucky to not be duped into some type of shady real-estate scheme or putting far too many eggs in your cake batter. Good thing this tutorial is here. You&#39;ll see that fractions allow us to view the world in entirely new ways. You&#39;ll see that everything doesn&#39;t have to be a whole. You&#39;ll be able to slice and dice and then put it all back together (and if you order now, we&#39;ll throw in a spatula warmer for no extra charge).

Equivalent fractions and simplified form
There are literally infinite ways to represent any fraction (or number for that matter). Don&#39;t believe us? Let&#39;s take 1/3. 2/6, 3/9, 4/12 ... 10001/30003 are all equivalent fractions (and we could keep going)! If you know the basics of what a fraction is, this is a great tutorial for recognizing when fractions are equivalent and then simplifying them as much as possible!

Mixed numbers and improper fractions
We can often have fractions whose numerators are not less than the denominators (like 23/4 or 3/2 or even 6/6). These top-heavy friends are called improper fractions. Since they represent a whole or more (in absolute terms), they can also be expressed as a combination of a whole number and a &quot;proper fraction&quot; (one where the numerator is less than the denominator) which is called a &quot;mixed number.&quot; They are both awesome ways of representing a number and getting acquainted with both (as this tutorial does) is super useful in life!

Concept of multiplication and division
Let&#39;s introduce ourselves to two of the most fundamental ideas in all of mathematics: multiplication and division!
Intro to multiplication
Multiplication as groups of objects
More on the concept of multiplication
The idea of division
Basic multiplication
If 3 kids each have two robot possums, how many total robot possums do we have? You liked addition, but now you&#39;re ready to go to the next level. Depending on how you view it, multiplication is about repeated addition or scaling a number or seeing what number you get when you have another number multiple times. If that last sentence made little sense, you might enjoy this tutorial.

One-digit division
Every time you split your avocado harvest with your 10 pet robot possums, you&#39;ve been dividing. You don&#39;t farm avocados? You only have 8 robot possums? No worries. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve divided as well. Multiplication is awesome, but you&#39;re ready for the next step. Division is the art of trying to split things into equal groups. Like subtraction undoes addition, division also undoes multiplication. After this tutorial, you&#39;ll have a basic understanding of all of the core operations in arithmetic!

Place value
You&#39;ve been counting for a while now. It&#39;s second nature to go from &quot;9&quot; to &quot;10&quot; or &quot;99&quot; to &quot;100&quot;, but what are you really doing when you add another digit? How do we represent so many numbers (really as many as we want) with only 10 number symbols (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)? In this tutorial you&#39;ll learn about place value. This is key to better understanding what you&#39;re really doing when you count, carry, regroup, multiply and divide with mult-digit numbers. If you really think about it, it might change your worldview forever!

Rounding whole numbers
If you&#39;re looking to create an army of robot dogs, will it really make a difference if you have 10,300 dogs, 9,997 dogs or 10,005 dogs? Probably not. All you really care about is how many dogs you have to, say, the nearest thousand (10,000 dogs). In this tutorial, you&#39;ll learn about conventions for rounding whole numbers. Very useful when you might not need to (or cannot) be completely precise.

Regrouping involves taking value from one place and giving it to another. It is a great way to make sure you understand place value. It is also super useful when subtracting multi-digit numbers (the process is often called &quot;borrowing&quot; even though you never really &quot;pay back&quot; the value taken from one place and given to another).

Order of operations
If you have the expression &quot;3 + 4 x 5&quot;, do you add the 3 to the 4 first or multiply the 4 and 5 first? To clear up confusion here, the math world has defined which operation should get priority over others. This is super important. You won&#39;t really be able to do any involved math if you don&#39;t get this clear. But don&#39;t worry, this tutorial has your back.

The distributive property
The distributive property is an idea that shows up over and over again in mathematics. It is the idea that 5 x (3 + 4) = (5 x 3) + (5 x 4). If that last statement made complete sense, no need to watch this tutorial. If it didn&#39;t or you don&#39;t know why it&#39;s true, then this tutorial might be a good way to pass the time :)

Arithmetic properties
2 + 3 = 3 + 2, 6 x 4 = 4 x 6. Adding zero to a number does not change the number. Likewise, multiplying a number by 1 does not change it. You may already know these things from working through other tutorials, but some people (not us) like to give these properties names that sound far more complicated than the property themselves. This tutorial (which we&#39;re not a fan of), is here just in case you&#39;re asked to identify the &quot;Commutative Law of Multiplication&quot;. We believe the important thing isn&#39;t the fancy label, but the underlying idea (which isn&#39;t that fancy).

Equations of normal and tangent lines
A derivative at a point in a curve can be viewed as the slope of the line tangent to that curve at that point. Given this, the natural next question is what the equation of that tangent line is. In this tutorial, we&#39;ll not only find equations of tangent lines, but normal ones as well!

Applications of derivatives: Tangent and normal lines
Motion along a line
Derivatives can be used to calculate instantaneous rates of change. The rate of change of position with respect to time is velocity and the rate of change of velocity with respect to time is acceleration. Using these ideas, we&#39;ll be able to analyze one-dimensional particle movement given position as a function of time.

Critical points and graphing with calculus
Can calculus be used to figure out when a function takes on a local or global maximum value? Absolutely. Not only that, but derivatives and second derivatives can also help us understand the shape of the function (whether they are concave upward or downward). If you have a basic conceptual understanding of derivatives, then you can start applying that knowledge here to identify critical points, extrema, inflections points and even to graph functions.

L&#39;Hôpital&#39;s rule
Limits have done their part helping to find derivatives. Now, under the guidance of l&#39;Hôpital&#39;s rule, derivatives are looking to show their gratitude by helping to find limits. Ever try to evaluate a function at a point and get 0/0 or infinity/infinity? Well, that&#39;s a big clue that l&#39;Hopital&#39;s rule can help you find the limit of the function at that point.

Divergence theorem (3D)
An earlier tutorial used Green&#39;s theorem to prove the divergence theorem in 2-D, this tutorial gives us the 3-D version (what most people are talking about when they refer to the &quot;divergence theorem&quot;). We will get an intuition for it (that the flux through a close surface--like a balloon--should be equal to the divergence across it&#39;s volume). We will use it in examples. We will prove it in another tutorial.

Limits
Limits are the core tool that we build upon for calculus. Many times, a function can be undefined at a point, but we can think about what the function &quot;approaches&quot; as it gets closer and closer to that point (this is the &quot;limit&quot;). Other times, the function may be defined at a point, but it may approach a different limit. There are many, many times where the function value is the same as the limit at a point. Either way, this is a powerful tool as we start thinking about slope of a tangent line to a curve. If you have a decent background in algebra (graphing and functions in particular), you&#39;ll hopefully enjoy this tutorial!
Introduction to limits
Inferring limit from numerical data
Estimating limit numerically
Finding limits numerically
Estimating limits from graphs
In this tutorial, we will build our ability to visualize limits by estimating them based on graphs of functions. We will look at both one-sided and two-sided limits.
One-sided limits from graphs
One-sided limits from graphs
Limit at a point of discontinuity
Determining which limit statements are true
2 sided limit from graph
Two-sided limits from graphs
Finding limits algebraically
We often attempt to find the limit at a point where the function itself is not defined. In this tutorial, we will use algebra to &quot;simplify&quot; functions into ones where it is defined. Given that the original function and the simplified one may be identical except for the limit point in question, this is a useful way of finding limits.
Limit example 1

Two-sided limits using algebra
Limit by factoring cubic expression
Two-sided limits using advanced algebra
Continuity using limits
A function isn&#39;t continuous when there is a &quot;break&quot; in its graph. This tutorial uses limits to define this idea more formally and gives practice thinking about continuity (and discontinuity) in terms of limits.

Old limits tutorial
This tutorial covers much of the same material as the &quot;Limits&quot; tutorial, but does it with Sal&#39;s original &quot;old school&quot; videos. The sound, resolution or handwriting isn&#39;t as good, but some people find them more charming.

Limits and infinity
You have a basic understanding of what a limit is. Now, in this tutorial, we can explore situation where we take the limit as x approaches negative or positive infinity (and situations where the limit itself could be unbounded).

Visually determining vertical asymptotes
Limits at infinity where f(x) is unbounded

Squeeze theorem
If a function is always smaller than one function and always greater than another (i.e. it is always between them), then if the upper and lower function converge to a limit at a point, then so does the one in between. Not only is this useful for proving certain tricky limits (we use it to prove lim (x → 0) of (sin x)/x, but it is a useful metaphor to use in life (seriously). :) This tutorial is useful but optional. It is covered in most calculus courses, but it is not necessary to progress on to the &quot;Introduction to derivatives&quot; tutorial.
Squeeze theorem or sandwich theorem
Squeeze theorem exercise example

Proof: lim (sin x)/x
Epsilon delta definition of limits
This tutorial introduces a &quot;formal&quot; definition of limits. So put on your ball gown and/or tuxedo to party with Mr. Epsilon Delta (no, this is not referring to a fraternity). This tends to be covered early in a traditional calculus class (right after basic limits), but we have mixed feelings about that. It is cool and rigorous, but also very &quot;mathy&quot; (as most rigorous things are). Don&#39;t fret if you have trouble with it the first time. If you have a basic conceptual understanding of what limits are (from the &quot;Limits&quot; tutorial), you&#39;re ready to start thinking about taking derivatives.

Partial derivatives
Let&#39;s jump out of that boring (okay, it wasn&#39;t THAT boring) 2-D world into the exciting 3-D world that we all live and breath in. Instead of functions of x that can be visualized as lines, we can have functions of x and y that can be visualized as surfaces. But does the idea of a derivative still make sense? Of course it does! As long as you specify what direction you&#39;re going in. Welcome to the world of partial derivatives!

Divergence
Is a vector field &quot;coming together&quot; or &quot;drawing apart&quot; at a given point in space. The divergence is a vector operator that gives us a scalar value at any point in a vector field. If it is positive, then we are diverging. Otherwise, we are converging!

Disc method
You know how to use definite integrals to find areas under curves. We now take that idea for &quot;spin&quot; by thinking about the volumes of things created when you rotate functions around various lines.

4th grade (U.S.)
4th grade is the time to start really fine-tuning your arithmetic skills. Not only will you be a multi-digit addition and subtraction rockstar, but you&#39;ll extend the multiplication and division that you started in 3rd grade to several digits. You&#39;ll also discover that you sometimes have something left over (called a &quot;remainder&quot;) when you divide. In 3rd grade you learned what a fraction is. Now you&#39;ll start adding, subtracting, multiplying, and comparing them. You&#39;ll also see how they relate to decimals. On other fronts, you&#39;ll learn how to convert between different units (which is super important when comparing the size and speed of robot unicorns in different countries) and continue your journey thinking about various shapes in two dimensions. Some of the foundational concepts of geometry (like lines, rays and angles) also get introduced. As always, we&#39;ll round this out with a healthy dose of applied word problems and explorations of number patterns and properties (including the ideas of factors, multiples and prime numbers). The fun must not stop! (Content was selected for this grade level based on a typical curriculum in the United States.)

Multiplication and division

Let&#39;s continue on the multiplication and division adventure that was started in third grade--now we&#39;ll think about these operations with multi-digit numbers and discover that we sometimes have something left over, or a remainder, when we divide.

Fractions

In 3rd grade, you got a basic conceptual understanding of what a fraction is. Now we dig deeper by comparing fractions and starting to perform operations on them. We also see how they relate to decimals.
	 26  9
Measurement and data

When we measure anything, we do it in human-defined &#39;units&#39;. Different units were defined in different places and for different scales. Let&#39;s think about how to convert between the them! We&#39;ll also get our feet wet in angles and continue thinking about perimeter and area!

Factors, multiples and patterns

We know that 3x2x5 = 30. So 2, 3, and 5 are factors of 30. 30 is a multiple of each of 3, 2, and 5. If a number only has itself and 1 as factors, then the number is &quot;prime&quot;. Don&#39;t worry, this is explained in much more depth in the tutorials in this topic. We will also explore some mathematical patterns.

Comparing and sampling populations
When we are trying to make a judgement about a population, it is often impractical (or impossible) to observe every member of the population. For example, imaging trying to survey all 300+ million Americans to understand the likely outcome of the next presidential election! Because of this, much of statistics is making estimates about a population based on a random sample. This tutorial introduces you to the idea of what makes a good random sample. I&#39;m sure all of you would enjoy it (but I haven&#39;t had the time to ask all of you).

Basic probability
Can I pick a red frog out of a bag that only contains marbles? Is it smart to buy a lottery ticket? Even if we are unsure about whether something will happen, can we start to be mathematical about the &quot;chances&quot; of an event (essentially realizing that some things are more likely than others). This tutorial will introduce us to the tools that allow us to think about random events. Common Core standards: 7.SP.C.5, 7.SP.C.7a,

Estimating probability
If you know all of the possible outcomes of a trial (and the associated probabilities of each of them), you can find the exact probability. In many situations, however, we don&#39;t know this and instead, we estimate the probability based on history of events. That&#39;s what we&#39;re going to do in this tutorial.

What&#39;s the probability of picking two &quot;e&quot; from the bag in scrabble (assuming that I don&#39;t replace the tiles). Well, the probability of picking an &#39;e&#39; on your second try depends on what happened in the first (if you picked an &#39;e&#39; the first time around, then there is one less &#39;e&#39; in the bag). This is just one of many, many type of scenarios involving dependent probability.

Order of operations
If you have the expression &quot;3 + 4 x 5&quot;, do you add the 3 to the 4 first or multiply the 4 and 5 first? To clear up confusion here, the math world has defined which operation should get priority over others. This is super important.

In 3rd grade, you learned that there is an easier way to write &quot;5+5+5&quot;. You saw that 5+5+5=3x5. But is there an easier way to write repeated multiplication (like &quot;5x5x5&quot;)? Absolutely! That&#39;s exactly what exponents are for! Common Core Standard: 6.EE.A.1

Anyway, unless you&#39;ve watched this tutorial, you&#39;re really in no position to argue otherwise. As you&#39;ll see &quot;percent&quot; literally means &quot;per cent&quot; or &quot;per hundred&quot;. It&#39;s a pseudo-decimally thing that our society likes to use even though decimals or fractions alone would have done the trick. Either way, we&#39;re 100% sure you&#39;ll find this useful.

3rd grade (U.S.)
3rd grade is full of some of the most important ideas in mathematics. You&#39;ll extend the addition and subtraction that you did in second grade to more than two digits. You will also get your first exposure to the ideas of multiplication, division, and fractions, which will be used the rest of your mathematical lives (we&#39;ll even use some letters as placeholders for unknown numbers along the way). 3rd grade is also when we first think about area (how much &quot;space&quot; something takes on a surface) and perimeter (the distance around a shape). All of that will be rounded out by making sure that you can apply these ideas in the real world and see patterns in the mathematical world. (Content was selected for this grade level based on a typical curriculum in the United States.)
 Community Questions

Addition and subtraction

In the 2nd grade you learned to add and subtract 2-digit numbers. Now we take things further by adding and subtracting three-digit numbers. This is good practice for 4th grade where you&#39;ll be expected to add or subtract pretty much any whole number!
	 14  28
Multiplication and division

Multiplication and division are two of the most important operations to understand in math. If you drink 2 cups of water, 5 times, how much water have you drunk? If you need to divide 9 slices of cake between 3 friends, how much cake does each friend get?

What fractions mean
If you don&#39;t understand fractions, you won&#39;t be even 1/3 educated. Glasses will seem half empty rather than half full. You&#39;ll be lucky to not be duped into some type of shady real-estate scheme or putting far too many eggs in your cake batter. Good thing this tutorial is here. You&#39;ll see that fractions allow us to view the world in entirely new ways. You&#39;ll see that everything doesn&#39;t have to be a whole. You&#39;ll be able to slice and dice and then put it all back together (and if you order now, we&#39;ll throw in a spatula warmer for no extra charge).

Intro to differential equations
How is a differential equation different from a regular one? Well, the solution is a function (or a class of functions), not a number. How do you like me now (that is what the differential equation would say in response to your shock)!
What is a differential equation
Simple differential equations
Separable equations
Arguably the &#39;easiest&#39; class of differential equations. Here we use our powers of algebra to &quot;separate&quot; the y&#39;s from the x&#39;s on two different sides of the equation and then we just integrate!

In this equations, all of the fat is fully mixed in so it doesn&#39;t collect at the top. No (that would be homogenized equations). Actually, the term &quot;homogeneous&quot; is way overused in differential equations. In this tutorial, we&#39;ll look at equations of the form y&#39;=(F(y/x)).

Perimeter and area of triangles
You first learned about perimeter and area when you were in grade school. In this tutorial, we will revisit those ideas with a more mathy lense. We will use our prior knowledge of congruence to really start to prove some neat (and useful) results (including some that will be useful in our study of similarity).

Pythagorean theorem
Named after the Greek philosopher who lived nearly 2600 years ago, the Pythagorean theorem is as good as math theorems get (Pythagoras also started a religious movement). It&#39;s simple. It&#39;s beautiful. It&#39;s powerful. In this tutorial, we will cover what it is and how it can be used. We have another tutorial that gives you as many proofs of it as you might need.

More than just satisfying any skepticism of whether the Pythagorean theorem is really true (only one proof would be sufficient for that), it will hopefully open your mind to new and beautiful ways to prove something very powerful.

Transformations and matrix multiplication
You probably remember how to multiply matrices from high school, but didn&#39;t know why or what it represented. This tutorial will address this. You&#39;ll see that multiplying two matrices can be view as the composition of linear transformations.

Matrix product examples

Inverse functions and transformations
You can use a transformation/function to map from one set to another, but can you invert it? In other words, is there a function/transformation that given the output of the original mapping, can output the original input (this is much clearer with diagrams). This tutorial addresses this question in a linear algebra context. Since matrices can represent linear transformations, we&#39;re going to spend a lot of time thinking about matrices that represent the inverse transformation.
Introduction to the inverse of a function
Proof: Invertibility implies a unique solution to f(x)=y
Surjective (onto) and injective (one-to-one) functions
Relating invertibility to being onto and one-to-one

Simplifying conditions for invertibility
Showing that inverses are linear
Finding inverses and determinants
We&#39;ve talked a lot about inverse transformations abstractly in the last tutorial. Now, we&#39;re ready to actually compute inverses. We start from &quot;documenting&quot; the row operations to get a matrix into reduced row echelon form and use this to come up with the formula for the inverse of a 2x2 matrix. After this we define a determinant for 2x2, 3x3 and nxn matrices.

More determinant depth
In the last tutorial on matrix inverses, we first defined what a determinant is and gave several examples of computing them. In this tutorial we go deeper. We will explore what happens to the determinant under several circumstances and conceptualize it in several ways.
Determinant when row multiplied by scalar
(correction) scalar multiplication of row
Determinant when row is added
Duplicate row determinant
Determinant after row operations

Measures of central tendency
This is the foundational tutorial for the rest of statistics. We start thinking about how you can represent a set of numbers with one number that somehow represents the &quot;center&quot;. We then talk about the differences between populations, samples, parameters and statistics.

Box-and-whisker plots
Whether you&#39;re looking at scientific data or stock price charts, box-and-whisker plots can show up in your life. This tutorial covers what they are, how to read them and how to construct them. We&#39;d consider this tutorial very optional, but it is a good application of dealing with medians and ranges.

Variance and standard deviation
We have tools (like the arithmetic mean) to measure central tendency and are now curious about representing how much the data in a set varies from that central tendency. In this tutorial we introduce the variance and standard deviation (which is just the square root of the variance) as two commonly used tools for doing this.

Normal distribution
The normal distribution (often referred to as the &quot;bell curve&quot; is at the core of most of inferential statistics. By assuming that most complex processes result in a normal distribution (we&#39;ll see why this is reasonable), we can gauge the probability of it happening by chance. To best enjoy this tutorial, it is good to come to it understanding what probability distributions and random variables are. You should also be very familiar with the notions of population and sample mean and standard deviation.

Sampling distribution
In this tutorial, we experience one of the most exciting ideas in statistics--the central limit theorem. Without it, it would be a lot harder to make any inferences about population parameters given sample statistics. It tells us that, regardless of what the population distribution looks like, the distribution of the sample means (you&#39;ll learn what that is) can be normal. Good idea to understand a bit about normal distributions before diving into this tutorial.

Confidence intervals
We all have confidence intervals (&quot;I&#39;m the king of the world!!!!&quot;) and non-confidence intervals (&quot;No one loves me&quot;). That is not what this tutorial is about. This tutorial takes what you already know about the central limit theorem, sampling distributions, and z-scores and uses these tools to dive into the world of inferential statistics. It may seem magical at first, but from our sample, we can now make inferences about the probability of our population mean actually being in an interval.
Confidence interval 1
Confidence interval example
Small sample size confidence intervals
Bernoulli distributions and margin of error
Ever wondered what pollsters are talking about when they said that there is a 3% &quot;margin of error&quot; in their results. Well, this tutorial will not only explain what it means, but give you the tools and understanding to be a pollster yourself!
Mean and variance of Bernoulli distribution example
Bernoulli distribution mean and variance formulas
Margin of error 1
Margin of error 2
Hypothesis testing with one sample
This tutorial helps us answer one of the most important questions not only in statistics, but all of science: how confident are we that a result from a new drug or process is not due to random chance but due to an actual impact. If you are familiar with sampling distributions and confidence intervals, you&#39;re ready for this adventure!
Hypothesis testing and p-values
One-tailed and two-tailed tests
Type 1 errors
Z-statistics vs. T-statistics
Small sample hypothesis test

Large sample proportion hypothesis testing
Hypothesis testing with two samples
You&#39;re already familiar with hypothesis testing with one sample. In this tutorial, we&#39;ll go further by testing whether the difference between the means of two samples seems to be unlikely purely due to chance.

Chi-square probability distribution
You&#39;ve gotten good at hypothesis testing when you can make assumptions about the underlying distributions. In this tutorial, we&#39;ll learn about a new distribution (the chi-square one) and how it can help you (yes, you) infer what an underlying distribution even is!
Chi-square distribution introduction
Pearson&#39;s chi square test (goodness of fit)
Contingency table chi-square test
Analysis of variance
You already know a good bit about hypothesis testing with one or two samples. Now we take things further by making inferences based on three or more samples. We&#39;ll use the very special F-distribution to do it (F stands for &quot;fabulous&quot;).

A detailed look at shapes that are prevalent in science: conic sections
 SUBSCRIBE
Conic section basics
What is a conic other than a jazz singer from New Orleans? Well, as you&#39;ll see in this tutorial, a conic section is formed when you intersect a plane with cones. You end up with some familiar shapes (like circles and ellipses) and some that are a bit unexpected (like hyperbolas). This tutorial gets you set up with the basics and is a good foundation for going deeper into the world of conic sections.
Introduction to conic sections
Recognizing conic sections
Circles
You&#39;ve seen circles your entire life. You&#39;ve even studied them a bit in math class. Now we go further, taking a deep look at the equations of circles.
Pythagorean theorem and the equation of a circle
Radius and center for a circle equation in standard form
Equation of a circle in factored form
Graphing circles
Completing the square to write equation in standard form of a circle
Equation of a circle in non-factored form

Ellipses
What would you call a circle that isn&#39;t a circle? One that is is is taller or fatter rather than being perfectly round? An ellipse. (All circles are special cases of ellipses.) In this tutorial we go deep into the equations and graphs of ellipses.
Conic sections: Intro to ellipses
Equation of an ellipse
Foci of an ellipse
Exploring the foci of an ellipse
Parabolas
You&#39;ve seen parabolas already when you graphed quadratic functions. Now we will look at them from a conic perspective. In particular we will look at them as the set of all points equidistant from a point (focus) and a line (directrix). Have fun!

Conics in the IIT JEE
Do you think that the math exams that you have to take are hard? Well, if you have the stomach, try the problem(s) in this tutorial. They are not only conceptually difficult, but they are also hairy. Don&#39;t worry if you have trouble with this. Most of us would. The IIT JEE is an exam administered to 200,000 students every year in India to select which 2000 go to the competitive IITs. They need to make sure that most of the students can&#39;t do most of the problems so that they can really whittle the applicants down.

Function introduction
Relationships can be any association between sets of numbers while functions have only one output for a given input. This tutorial works through a bunch of examples of testing whether something is a valid function. As always, we really encourage you to pause the videos and try the problems before Sal does!

Domain and range
What values can you and can you not input into a function? What values can the function output? The domain is the set of values that the function is defined for (i.e., the values that you can input into a function). The range is the set of values that the function output can take on. This tutorial covers the ideas of domain and range through multiple worked examples. These are really important ideas as you study higher mathematics.

Function inverses
Functions associate a set of inputs with a set of outputs (in fancy language, they &quot;map&quot; one set to another). But can we go the other way around? Are there functions that can start with the outputs as inputs and produce the original inputs as outputs? Yes, there are! They are called function inverses! This tutorial works through a bunch of examples to get you familiar with the world of function inverses.

Properties and features of functions
You know a function when you see one, but are curious to start looking deeper at their properties. Some functions seem to be mirror images around the y-axis while others seems to be flipped mirror images while others are neither. How can we shift and reflect them? This tutorial addresses these questions by covering even and odd functions. It also covers how we can shift and reflect them. Enjoy!

Undefined and indeterminate answers
In second grade you may have raised your hand in class and asked what you get when you divide by zero. The answer was probably &quot;it&#39;s not defined.&quot; In this tutorial we&#39;ll explore what that (and &quot;indeterminate&quot;) means and why the math world has left this gap in arithmetic. (They could define something divided by 0 as 7 or 9 or 119.57 but have decided not to.)

The imaginary unit i
This is where math starts to get really cool. It may see strange to define a number whose square is negative one. Why do we do this? Because it fits a nice niche in the math ecosystem and can be used to solve problems in engineering and science (not to mention some of the coolest fractals are based on imaginary and complex numbers). The more you think about it, you might realize that all numbers, not just i, are very abstract.

In this tutorial, we will explore the unit circle in more depth so that we can better appreciate how trig functions of an angle might relate to angles that are in some way symmetric within the unit circle. We&#39;ll also look at the periodicity of the functions themselves (why they repeat after a certain change in angle).

Factoring quadratics
Just saying the word &quot;quadratic&quot; will make you feel smart and powerful. Try it. Imagine how smart and powerful you would actually be if you know what a quadratic is. Even better, imagine being able to completely dominate these &quot;quadratics&quot; with new found powers of factorization. Well, dream no longer. This tutorial will be super fun. Just bring to it your equation solving skills, your ability to multiply binomials and a non-linear way of thinking!

Adding and multiplying polynomials
&quot;Polynomials&quot; sound like a fancy word, but you just have to break down the root words. &quot;Poly&quot; means &quot;many&quot;. So we&#39;re just talking about &quot;many nomials&quot; and everyone knows what a &quot;nomial&quot; is. Okay, most of us don&#39;t. Well, a polynomials has &quot;many&quot; terms. From understanding what a &quot;term&quot; is to basic simplification, addition and subtraction of polynomials, this tutorial will get you very familiar with the world of many &quot;nomials.&quot; :)

Dividing polynomials
You know what polynomials are. You know how to add, subtract, and multiply them. Unless you are completely incurious, you must be wondering how to divide them! In this tutorial we&#39;ll explore how we divide polynomials--both through algebraic long division and synthetic division. (We like classic algebraic long division more since you can actually understand what you&#39;re doing.)

Factoring and roots of higher degree polynomials
Factoring quadratics are now second nature to you. Even when traditional factoring is difficult, you know about completing the square and the quadratic formula. Now you&#39;re ready for something more interesting. Well, as you&#39;ll see in this tutorial, factoring higher degree polynomials is definitely the challenge you&#39;re looking for!

Partial fraction expansion
If you add several rational expressions with lower degree denominator, you are likely to get a sum with a higher degree denominator (which is the least-common multiple of the lower-degree ones). This tutorial lets us think about going the other way--start with a rational expression with a higher degree denominator and break it up as the sum of simpler rational expressions. This has many uses throughout mathematics. In particular, it is key when taking inverse Laplace transforms in differential equations (which you&#39;ll take, and rock, after calculus).

Fundamental Theorem of Algebra
This tutorial will better connect the world of complex numbers to roots of polynomials. It will show us that when we couldn&#39;t find roots, we just weren&#39;t looking hard enough. In particular, the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra tells us that every non-zero polynomial in one-variable of degree n has exactly n-roots (although they might not all be real!)

The Museum of Modern Art

With the world&#39;s finest collection of modern and contemporary art and a dynamic exhibition program, The Museum of Modern Art is a place for discovery and engagement that fuels creativity and inspires art enthusiasts of all ages and experiences. In the MoMA tutorials, you can explore the fascinating world of modern and contemporary artworks through artist interviews, behind-the-scenes, and how-to videos.

Printmaking
Artists have used printmaking to create some of their most profound and compelling works of art, yet the basic printmaking techniques remain a mystery to most people. These videos demonstrate three key printmaking processes—relief, intaglio, and lithography. They include prints from the Museum&#39;s collection to demonstrate the range of expressive effects associated with each technique.

1913 Centennial Celebration
1913 is a particularly important year within the history of modern art, marked by events and objects that would fundamentally change the way art was conceived and understood. In February of that year, the groundbreaking &quot;Armory Show&quot; introduced the American public to the work of Paul Cézanne, Pablo Picasso, Marcel Duchamp, and many other European artists exhibited alongside their American avant-garde counterparts. In this series of videos, curators from all areas of the Museum speak about their favorite works from 1913 in MoMA&#39;s collection.

Abstract Expressionism
More than sixty years have passed since the critic Robert Coates, writing in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 1946, first used the term “Abstract Expressionism” to describe the richly colored canvases of Hans Hofmann. Over the years the name has come to designate the paintings and sculptures of artists as different as Jackson Pollock and Barnett Newman, Willem de Kooning and Mark Rothko, Lee Krasner and David Smith. Watch these short videos to explore some of the most important abstract art of the 20th century and the artists&#39; experiments with techniques.

Performance Art
Theatrical and staged elements have been a key feature of visual art throughout the 20th century. Movements like Futurism, Dada, and Bauhaus employed theater, dance, music, and poetry with live or broadcast performances to engage with audiences. In the 1960s and 1970s, performance gained renewed momentum when artists conceived of Happenings, Fluxus, &quot;actions,&quot; experimental dance, and site-specific interventions. Throughout its history MoMA has been host to many artworks involving live and performative elements. While most of these activities previously took place at the periphery of MoMA&#39;s exhibition program, the 2008 addition of &quot;and Performance Art&quot; to what was then called the Department of Media introduced performance art as a central component in the Museum&#39;s programming.
	 12
MoMA Learning
The history of modern art is not simply a linear progression of styles. Rather, artists respond to and participate in the intellectual, social, and cultural contexts of their time. MoMA has a long history of experimental approaches to engaging people with art, which is at the core of the museum&#39;s mission. Listen to MoMA educators discuss how they teach challenging works of art, hear tips for teaching, and learn about MoMA&#39;s programs for individuals with dementia.</field>

Circulatory and pulmonary systems
As humans, we really like breathing oxygen. That&#39;s because the cells in our body will die if they don&#39;t get oxygen to function in a reasonable amount of time. This tutorials describes how we use the lungs to exchange gasses between our blood and the atmosphere and how the oxygen is then pumped through the body by way of blood and the circulatory system.

Is it a coincidence that Africa and South America could fit like puzzle pieces? Why do earthquakes happen where they do? What about volcanoes and mountains? Are all of these ideas linked? Yes, they are. This tutorial on plate-tectonics explains how and why the continents have shifted over time. In the process, we also explore the structure of the Earth, all the way down to the core.

Consumer and producer surplus
Many times, the equilibrium price is lower than the highest price some folks are willing to pay. For all consumers, this is called consumer surplus. Similarly, the price might be higher than the minimum price at which some are willing to produce. For all the producers, this is called producer surplus. This tutorial covers them both with an emphasis on the visual.
Demand curve as marginal benefit curve
Consumer surplus introduction
Total consumer surplus as area
Producer surplus
Deadweight loss
We can often lose economic efficiency because of things like price floors, ceilings and taxes. This loss in surplus (people who have more marginal benefit than marginal cost are not buying or people who have more marginal cost than benefit are buying) is called deadweight loss.

Public goods and externalities
In many scenarios thinking only about producers&#39; marginal cost or consumers&#39; marginal benefit does not fully capture *all* of the costs or benefits from the production/use of a product. In this tutorial, we explore these externalities (negative and positive ones) to think a bit deeper about ways to maximize total surplus not just for producers and consumers, but for society as a whole.

Introduction to economics
This tutorial (that only has one video) is an overview of what economics is. In particular it will tell you the difference between microeconomics (the subject you&#39;re in right now) and macroeconomics. Really good first watch to give you some context on the world of economics.
Introduction to economics
The demand curve
You&#39;ve probably heard of supply and demand. Well, this tutorial focuses on the demand part. All else equal, do people want more or less of something if the price goes down (what would you do)? Not only will you get an intuition for the way we typically depict a demand curve, you&#39;ll get an understanding for what might shift it.
Law of demand
Price of related products and demand
Change in expected future prices and demand
Changes in income, population, or preferences
Normal and inferior goods
Inferior goods clarification
The supply curve
Now we&#39;ll focus on the &quot;supply&quot; part of supply and demand. Supply curves (as we typically depict them) come out of the idea that producers will make more if they get paid more.
Law of supply
Factors affecting supply
Long term supply curve
Market equilibrium
You understand demand and supply. This tutorial puts it all together by thinking about where the two curves intersect. This point represents the equilibrium price and quantity which is, in an ideal world, where the market would transact.
Market equilibrium
Changes in market equilibrium
What drives oil prices
This tutorial tries to address a very important question in the real world--what drives oil prices? And we will do it using the tools of the supply and demand curves.

A dog is balancing on one arm on my head. Is my head applying a force to the dog&#39;s hand? If it weren&#39;t, wouldn&#39;t there be nothing to offset the pull of gravity causing the acrobatic dog to fall? What would we call this force? Can we have a general term from the component of a contact force that acts perpendicular to the plane of contact? These are absolutely normal questions to ask.

Balanced and unbalanced forces
You will often hear physics professors be careful to say &quot;net force&quot; or &quot;unbalanced force&quot; rather than just &quot;force&quot;. Why? This tutorial explains why and might give you more intuition about Newton&#39;s laws in the process.

Inclined planes and friction
We&#39;ve all slid down slides/snow-or-mud-covered-hills/railings at some point in our life (if not, you haven&#39;t really lived) and noticed that the smoother the surface the more we would accelerate (try to slide down a non-snow-or-mud-covered hill).

Bad commute? Baby crying? Bills to pay? Looking to take a bath with some Calgon (do a search on YouTube for context) to ease your tension? This tutorial has nothing (actually little, not nothing) to do with that. So far, most of the forces we&#39;ve been dealing with are forces of &quot;pushing&quot;--contact forces at the macro level because of atoms not wanting to get to close at the micro level. Now we&#39;ll deal with &quot;pulling&quot; force or tension (at a micro level this is the force of attraction between bonded atoms).

Displacement, velocity and time
This tutorial is the backbone of your understanding of kinematics (i.e., the motion of objects). You might already know that distance = rate x time. This tutorial essentially reviews that idea with a vector lens (we introduce you to vectors here as well). So strap your belts (actually this might not be necessary since we don&#39;t plan on decelerating in this tutorial) and prepare for a gentle ride of foundational physics knowledge.
Introduction to vectors and scalars
Calculating average velocity or speed
Solving for time
Displacement from time and velocity example
Acceleration
In a world full of unbalanced forces (which you learn more about when you study Newton&#39;s laws), you will have acceleration (which is the rate in change of velocity). Whether you&#39;re thinking about how fast a Porsche can get to 60mph or how long it takes for a passenger plane to get to the necessary speed for flight, this tutorial will help.

Kinematic formulas and projectile motion
We don&#39;t believe in memorizing formulas and neither should you (unless you want to live your life as a shadow of your true potential). This tutorial builds on what we know about displacement, velocity and acceleration to solve problems in kinematics (including projectile motion problems). Along the way, we derive (and re-derive) some of the classic formulas that you might see in your physics book.

Deriving displacement as a function of time, acceleration and initial velocity

Torque, moments, and angular momentum
Until this tutorial, we have been completely ignoring that things rotate. In this tutorial, we&#39;ll explore why they rotate and how they do it. It will leave your head spinning (no, it won&#39;t, but seemed like a fun thing to say given the subject matter).

Two-dimensional motion
You understand velocity and acceleration well in one-dimension. Now we can explore scenarios that are even more fun. With a little bit of trigonometry (you might want to review your basic trig, especially what sin and cos are), we can think about whether a baseball can clear the &quot;green monster&quot; at Fenway Park.

Two-dimensional projectile motion
Let&#39;s escape from the binds of one-dimension (where we were forced to launch things straight up) and start launching at angles. With a little bit of trig (might want to review sin and cos) we&#39;ll be figuring out just how long and far something can travel.

Projectile motion with ordered set notation
Optimal angle for a projectile
This tutorial tackles a fundamental question when trying to launch things as far as possible (key if you&#39;re looking to capture a fort with anything from water balloons to arrows). With a bit of calculus, we&#39;ll get to a fairly intuitive answer.
Optimal angle for a projectile part 1
Optimal angle for a projectile part 2: Hangtime
Optimal angle for a projectile part 3: Horizontal distance as a function of angle (and speed)
Optimal angle for a projectile part 4: Finding the optimal angle and distance with a bit of calculus
Centripetal acceleration
Why do things move in circles? Seriously. Why does *anything* ever move in a circle (straight lines seem much more natural). ? Is something moving in a circle at a constant speed accelerating? If so, in what direction? This tutorial will help you get mind around this super-fun topic.

Work and energy
You&#39;re doing a lot more work than you realize (most of which goes unpaid). This tutorial will have you seeing the world in terms of potentials and energy and work (which is more fun than you can possibly imagine).
Introduction to work and energy
Work and energy (part 2)
Conservation of energy
Work/energy problem with friction
Mechanical advantage
If you have ever used a tool of any kind (including the bones in your body), you have employed mechanical advantage. Whether you used an incline plane to drag something off of a pick-up truck, or the back of a hammer to remove a nail, the world of mechanical advantage surrounds us.
Introduction to mechanical advantage
Mechanical advantage (part 2)
Mechanical advantage (part 3)
Springs and Hooke&#39;s law
Weighing machines of all sorts employ springs that take a certain amount of force to keep compressed or stretched to a certain point. Hooke&#39;s law will give us all the tools to weigh in on the subject ourselves and spring into action (yes, the puns are annoying us too)!
